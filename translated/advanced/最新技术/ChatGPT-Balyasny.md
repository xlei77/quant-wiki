# Hedge Fund AI Outperforms ChatGPT? Balyasny Builds Dedicated AI Team

In today's artificial intelligence landscape, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become core tools for transforming information processing and decision-making processes. However, the training data of models alone doesn't always meet the high-quality information needs of complex application scenarios. This is where "Retrieval Augmented Generation" (RAG) technology comes into play. Simply put, the key to RAG is to provide an "external brain" for LLMs—when answering complex questions, it can retrieve and embed external data in real-time based on user needs, providing more targeted answers. For the financial industry, the application of this technology is particularly sensitive and challenging, as high-quality financial information is both difficult to obtain and requires specialized interpretation.

## Challenges and Opportunities of RAG in Finance

In financial investment, timeliness, accuracy, and expertise are core elements. A hedge fund analyst or trader often needs to quickly judge the value trend of a stock, bond, or financial derivative in a rapidly changing market environment, and estimate the potential impact of major events (such as policy changes, geopolitical conflicts, industrial transformation). Such decisions require not only the model's inherent common sense and historical data but also the latest financial news, research reports, financial statements, and various policy and regulatory information.

Traditional LLMs are usually trained on general texts, allowing them to broadly understand human language and cover general knowledge and topics, but they may not be sensitive to industry-specific "jargon" or special data structures. Hedge fund managers and data scientists cannot rely entirely on a general model that has high requirements for timeliness and expertise but still has information blind spots. RAG thus becomes an ideal solution: by embedding external information retrieval results into the context of LLMs, it allows the model to incorporate the latest and more specialized external data sources when answering questions.

## Balyasny's AI Team: Attracting Talent from Google, DeepMind to Build Proprietary Tools

Among the many institutions attempting to apply RAG to the financial sector, hedge fund Balyasny Asset Management can be considered a pioneer. The fund has attracted senior personnel from Google and DeepMind to form an applied AI research team dedicated to developing AI tools for internal business. One of the most notable products is **BAMChatGPT**—a chatbot tailored for internal traders and analysts.

According to Michal Mucha, the engineer responsible for developing this tool, these AI tools are currently used by about 80% of Balyasny's employees. Whether it's wanting to instantly understand the latest developments of a stock held by the company or assessing the potential impact of geopolitical events on the investment portfolio, BAMChatGPT can provide valuable initial advice to a certain extent. Although these tools cannot replace independent judgment by human experts, they can greatly improve the efficiency of research and decision-making.

## BAM Embeddings: New Embeddings Designed for Financial "Jargon"

Earlier this month, Balyasny announced its new achievement, **BAM Embeddings**, in an academic paper. To understand the significance of this technology, we need to know what role "embeddings" play in the RAG process. For LLMs, embeddings are the key step in converting text into computable vector representations, allowing the model to understand text semantics mathematically. When an LLM needs to call external materials, it first needs to vectorize the text materials through a specific embedding model, so that it can efficiently retrieve and match the most relevant information fragments to the user's question.

However, general embedding models often lack understanding of industry-specific terminology. For example, the financial sector is full of various abbreviations, complex terms, and professional idiomatic expressions, which appear infrequently in general corpora and are often poorly understood by models. BAM Embeddings aims to solve this problem: it has been optimized and trained for the "obscure jargon" of the financial industry, allowing the embedding model to better understand and match relevant information.

The preliminary experimental results are impressive. When researchers asked the LLM (in this case, the Mistral 7B Instruct model) to search for the most relevant paragraphs in a set of financial documents, using BAM Embeddings could return the optimal fragment in over 60% of cases, while using OpenAI's general-purpose embeddings was less than 40%. On the public LLM benchmark platform FinanceBench, BAM Embeddings achieved a query accuracy of 55%, while OpenAI's ada-002 embeddings only reached 47%. This data comparison shows that in financial contexts, proprietary embeddings can indeed significantly improve the accuracy of information retrieval and question answering.

## Imperfect Reality: Hallucinations and Potential Risks

Although the results are encouraging, it doesn't mean that Balyasny's solution is flawless. In the FinanceBench test, answers using BAM Embeddings still had an error rate of about 30%. This indicates that even with the introduction of RAG, the problem of LLM "hallucinations" still exists, and the model may still provide fabricated or illogical answers.

Research shows that hallucinations are common in current LLM applications. A study in July showed that GPT-3.5, widely used in algorithmic trading, still had 27.8% of answers containing hallucinations when using RAG. Balyasny's BAM Embeddings used 14.3 million synthetic queries in the training process. While this massive synthetic dataset can enhance the model's understanding in specific domains, some experts worry that it might introduce biases or misleading information in specific contexts, making it difficult to further reduce the hallucination rate.

## Industry Trend: The Rise of RAG and Enterprise Application Prospects

Despite some shortcomings, Balyasny's attempt is still forward-looking and competitive. In actual enterprise application scenarios, RAG has become one of the mainstream trends. According to a report by venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, RAG will be the primary AI architecture method for 51% of enterprises in 2024, a significant increase from 31% in the previous year. For a hedge fund that needs to respond quickly to market changes and information needs, this early deployment of cutting-edge technology undoubtedly provides a major advantage in fierce competition.

## Looking Ahead: Specialization and Customization

As more and more enterprises incorporate RAG into their core strategies, general LLMs and embedding solutions may not meet the needs of highly specialized fields. Balyasny's case demonstrates a possible future trend: the rise of industry-customized AI tools. This is not just optimization at the algorithmic level, but a deep integration of data, models, and application scenarios.

Here's the English translation, maintaining the technical accuracy, formatting, and style of the original text:

In this process, we may see more proprietary embedding models and LLMs trained by financial institutions, providing decision-support tools with higher precision, timeliness, and interpretability in areas such as understanding financial terminology, capturing market signals, and gaining insights into macroeconomic variable changes. As exemplified by Balyasny's current attempts, it is expected to bring new insights and value to the entire financial AI ecosystem through continuous optimization and iteration.
