# Hedge Fund AI Outperforms ChatGPT? Balyasny Builds Dedicated AI Team

In today's artificial intelligence landscape, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become core tools for transforming information processing and decision-making workflows. However, the training data of models alone cannot always meet the high-quality information requirements of complex application scenarios. This is where Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology comes into play. Simply put, RAG's key feature is providing an "external brain" for LLMs—when answering complex questions, it can retrieve and embed external data in real-time based on user needs, providing more targeted answers. For the financial industry, the application of this technology is particularly sensitive and challenging, as high-quality financial information is both difficult to obtain and requires professional interpretation.

## RAG Challenges and Opportunities in Finance

In financial investment, timeliness, accuracy, and expertise are core elements. A hedge fund analyst or trader often needs to quickly assess the value trajectory of stocks, bonds, or financial derivatives in a rapidly changing market environment, and estimate the potential impact of major events (such as policy changes, geopolitical conflicts, industrial transformation). Such decisions require not only the inherent knowledge and historical data within models but also the latest financial news, research reports, financial statements, and various policy and regulatory information.

Traditional LLMs are typically trained on general text, enabling them to broadly understand human language and cover general knowledge and topics, but they may not be sensitive to industry-specific "jargon" or special data structures. Hedge fund managers and data scientists cannot completely rely on a general model that has information blind spots despite requiring extremely high timeliness and professional expertise. RAG therefore becomes an ideal solution: by embedding external information retrieval results into the LLM's context, it allows the model to incorporate the latest and more professionally focused external data sources when answering questions.

## Balyasny's AI Team: Recruiting Talent from Google and DeepMind to Build Proprietary Tools

Among institutions attempting to apply RAG in the financial sector, hedge fund Balyasny Asset Management stands as a pioneer. The fund has recruited senior professionals from Google and DeepMind to build an applied AI research team dedicated to developing AI tools for internal operations. One of their most notable products is **BAMChatGPT**—a chatbot specifically tailored for internal traders and analysts.

According to Michal Mucha, the engineer responsible for developing this tool, these AI tools are currently being used by approximately 80% of Balyasny's employees. Whether someone needs to instantly understand the latest developments of a stock held by the company or wants to assess the potential impact of geopolitical events on their portfolio, BAMChatGPT can provide valuable initial guidance to some extent. Although these tools cannot replace independent judgment by human experts, they can significantly improve the efficiency of research and decision-making.

## BAM Embeddings: A New Type of Embedding Designed for Financial "Jargon"

Earlier this month, Balyasny revealed its new achievement **BAM Embeddings** in an academic paper. To understand the significance of this technology, we need to know what role "embeddings" play in the RAG process. For LLMs, embeddings are a crucial step that converts text into computable vector representations, allowing models to understand text semantics mathematically. When LLMs need to access external resources, they first need to vectorize text materials through specific embedding models to efficiently retrieve and match the most relevant information segments to user queries.

However, general-purpose embedding models often lack understanding of industry-specific terminology. For example, the financial sector is filled with various abbreviations, complex terms, and professional idioms that appear infrequently in general corpora, leading to insufficient model comprehension. BAM Embeddings aims to solve this problem: it has been optimized and trained for financial industry "obscure jargon," enabling the embedding model to better understand and match relevant information.

Initial experimental results are remarkable. When researchers had LLMs (in this case, the Mistral 7B Instruct model) search for the most relevant passages in a set of financial documents, BAM Embeddings returned the optimal segments in over 60% of cases, while OpenAI's general-purpose embeddings achieved less than 40%. On the public LLM benchmark platform FinanceBench, BAM Embeddings achieved a query accuracy of 55%, while OpenAI's ada-002 embeddings only reached 47%. This comparison demonstrates that specialized embeddings can significantly improve information retrieval and question-answering accuracy in financial contexts.

## Imperfect Reality: Hallucinations and Potential Risks

Despite encouraging results, Balyasny's solution is not yet foolproof. In FinanceBench testing, answers using BAM Embeddings still showed an error rate of approximately 30%. This indicates that even with the introduction of RAG, the "hallucination" problem in LLMs persists, and the model may still provide fabricated or illogical responses.

Research shows that hallucinations remain prevalent in current LLM applications. A July study revealed that GPT-3.5, widely used in algorithmic trading, still exhibited a 27.8% hallucination rate when using RAG. While Balyasny's BAM Embeddings used 14.3 million synthetic queries during training, and this massive synthetic dataset can enhance the model's domain-specific understanding, experts worry that it might introduce biases or context-specific misleading information, making it difficult to further reduce the hallucination rate.

## Industry Trends: The Rise of RAG and Its Enterprise Application Prospects

Despite some limitations, Balyasny's attempt remains forward-looking and competitive. In real enterprise application scenarios, RAG has become one of the mainstream trends. According to a report by venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, RAG will become the primary AI architectural approach for 51% of enterprises in 2024, a significant increase from 31% in the previous year. For a hedge fund that needs to quickly respond to market changes and information demands, taking an early position in this cutting-edge technology undoubtedly provides a major advantage in intense competition.

## Looking Forward: Specialization and Customization

As more companies incorporate RAG into their core strategies, general-purpose LLMs and embedding solutions may not meet the needs of highly specialized domains. The Balyasny case highlights a potential future trend: the rise of industry-customized AI tools. This involves not just algorithmic optimization, but also deep integration of data, models, and application scenarios.

In this process, we may see more proprietary embedding models and LLMs trained by financial institutions themselves, providing decision support tools with higher precision, timeliness, and interpretability in areas such as understanding financial terminology, capturing market signals, and analyzing macroeconomic variable changes. As demonstrated by Balyasny's current experiments, through continuous optimization and iteration, it has the potential to bring new insights and value to the entire financial AI ecosystem.
