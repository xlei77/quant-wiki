### Chapter 1: Who is it for? Why write it? How to read it?

This book is primarily aimed at portfolio managers and quantitative researchers who wish to gain a deeper understanding of quantitative investing. Whether you're a seasoned investor or a researcher in the quantitative field, this book provides a complete path from basic theory to practice. Giuseppe emphasizes that although the book involves a lot of mathematical concepts, understanding these tools is crucial for portfolio management. He encourages readers to carefully study the chapters marked with "â˜…" to delve into the technical details behind them.

### Chapter 2: From Concept to Profit: The Challenge

The core challenge of quantitative investing is how to translate theoretical concepts into actual profits. This chapter first discusses the core issues in investing, such as how to invest using your advantages and reduce uncertainty risk through hedging. At the same time, Giuseppe also delves into how to effectively use data analysis to optimize investment decisions.

Key formulas include:
$$ R(t) = \alpha + \beta_m \cdot M(t) + \epsilon(t) $$
This formula indicates that the return of an asset is determined by the market factor return $$ M(t) $$, the asset's market risk exposure $$ \beta_m $$, and idiosyncratic risk $$ \epsilon(t) $$.

### Chapter 3: A Tour of Risk and Performance

Factor models are one of the most commonly used tools in quantitative investing for decomposing risk and attributing performance. This chapter introduces how to use market factors to explain asset returns through a simple single-factor model.

Core formula:
$$ r_i = \alpha_i + \beta_i \cdot F + \epsilon_i $$

Here, $$ \beta_i $$ is the asset's exposure to the factor, $$ F $$ is the factor return, and $$ \epsilon_i $$ is the asset's idiosyncratic return. This chapter further demonstrates how to estimate $$ \alpha $$ and $$ \beta $$ through regression analysis, thereby separating systematic and idiosyncratic risks.

---

### Chapter 4: Introduction to Multi-Factor Models

Single-factor models have limitations as they cannot explain multiple market drivers. This chapter introduces multi-factor models, expanding the framework for risk decomposition.

The formula is as follows:

$$ M(t) $$0

Through multiple factors, investors can more precisely measure the risk and return of different assets. This chapter also discusses in detail how to calculate asset exposures to multiple factors through factor regression.

---

### Chapter 5: Understanding Factors

Factor models can help investors understand the main drivers in the market, such as macroeconomic factors, industry factors, and valuation factors. This chapter deeply analyzes how these factors affect asset returns and demonstrates how to manage risk by adjusting factor exposures in the portfolio.

Formula:
$$ M(t) $$1

Through this formula, investors can estimate the contribution of factors to returns, thereby optimizing the portfolio.

---

### Chapter 6: Effective Alpha Sizing Strategies

This chapter focuses on how to adjust the size of Alpha in the portfolio based on risk. The Sharpe ratio is a commonly used metric for measuring risk-adjusted returns of a portfolio, with the formula as follows:

$$ M(t) $$2

Through risk adjustment, investors can maximize returns at a certain risk level. Additionally, the chapter discusses position adjustment strategies based on historical data, helping readers find the optimal balance point in market fluctuations.

---

### Chapter 7: Factor Risk Management

Factor risk management is a core part of quantitative investing. This chapter discusses how to control factor risk by setting market exposure limits and single stock holding limits. Through these risk management tools, investors can reduce non-systematic risk in the portfolio.

Moreover, this chapter introduces how to reduce the impact of market volatility through strategic and tactical factor adjustments.

Formula:
$$ M(t) $$3

This formula is used to calculate the risk exposure of the portfolio $$ M(t) $$4, where $$ M(t) $$5 is the covariance matrix and $$ M(t) $$6 is the portfolio weights.

### Chapter 8: Understanding Your Performance

Performance attribution is an important tool for understanding the sources of investment returns. This chapter introduces how factor analysis can help investors understand the sources of their returns. Through regression analysis and attribution models, investors can identify which factors contribute most to portfolio returns.

Formula:
$$ M(t) $$7

This formula shows the factor decomposition of portfolio returns, helping investors optimize their strategies.

---

### Chapter 9: Managing Losses

Stop-loss strategies are crucial in risk management. This chapter details how to set effective stop-loss points, as well as the costs and benefits of these strategies.

Formula:
$$ M(t) $$8

This formula describes the loss calculation method, where a loss will be triggered when the asset return falls below a set threshold. This chapter emphasizes the importance of stop-loss strategies in risk management, especially during extreme market volatility.

---

### Chapter 10: Setting Sustainable Leverage Ratios

Leverage is an effective tool for amplifying returns and risks. This chapter explores how to set reasonable leverage ratios to ensure the long-term sustainability of investment operations. Giuseppe provides a leverage decision framework based on volatility and returns, helping investors balance returns and risks.

Formula:
$$ M(t) $$9

This formula helps investors determine the leverage multiple of the portfolio, thereby optimizing risk-adjusted returns.

### Appendix: Key Risk Model Formulas

The appendix provides multiple mathematical formulas, including factor models, variance minimization, mean-variance optimization, etc. These tools help investors better understand and apply complex quantitative investment strategies.
