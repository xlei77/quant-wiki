### Chapter 1: Who Is It Written For? Why Write It? How to Read It?

This book is primarily aimed at portfolio managers and quantitative researchers who wish to gain a deeper understanding of quantitative investment. Whether you are an experienced investor or a researcher in the quantitative field, this book provides a complete path from fundamental theory to practical application. Giuseppe emphasizes that although the book involves many mathematical concepts, understanding these tools is crucial for portfolio management. He encourages readers to carefully study the chapters marked with "â˜…" to gain a deeper understanding of the technical details behind them.

### Chapter 2: From Concept to Profit - The Challenge

The core challenge of quantitative investment is how to transform theoretical concepts into actual profits. This chapter first discusses the fundamental issues in investing, such as how to invest using your advantages and reduce uncertainty risks through hedging. Additionally, Giuseppe delves into how to effectively utilize data analysis to optimize investment decisions.

Key formulas include:
$$ R(t) = \alpha + \beta_m \cdot M(t) + \epsilon(t) $$
This formula indicates that an asset's return is determined by the market factor return $$ M(t) $$, the asset's market risk exposure $$ \beta_m $$, and idiosyncratic risk $$ \epsilon(t) $$.

### Chapter 3: A Tour of Risk and Performance

Factor models are one of the most commonly used tools in quantitative investment, used for risk decomposition and performance attribution. This chapter introduces how to use market factors to explain asset returns through simple single-factor models.

Core formula:
$$ r_i = \alpha_i + \beta_i \cdot F + \epsilon_i $$

Here, $$ \beta_i $$ is the asset's exposure to the factor, $$ F $$ is the factor return, and $$ \epsilon_i $$ is the asset's idiosyncratic return. This chapter further demonstrates how to estimate $$ \alpha $$ and $$ \beta $$ through regression analysis, thereby separating systematic risk from idiosyncratic risk.

### Chapter 4: Introduction to Multi-Factor Models

The single-factor model has its limitations as it cannot explain multiple market drivers. This chapter introduces multi-factor models, expanding the framework for risk decomposition.

The formula is as follows:

$$ M(t) $$0

Through multiple factors, investors can measure risk and return across different assets more precisely. This chapter also discusses in detail how to calculate asset exposures to multiple factors through factor regression.

---

### Chapter 5: Understanding Factors

Factor models help investors understand the main drivers in the market, such as macroeconomic factors, industry factors, and valuation factors. This chapter delves into how these factors affect asset returns and demonstrates how to manage risk by adjusting factor exposures in portfolios.

Formula:
$$ M(t) $$1

Through this formula, investors can estimate the contribution of factors to returns and thereby optimize their portfolios.

---

### Chapter 6: Effective Alpha Sizing Strategies

This chapter focuses on how to adjust Alpha sizes in portfolios based on risk. The Sharpe ratio is a commonly used metric for measuring risk-adjusted portfolio returns, calculated as follows:

$$ M(t) $$2

Through risk adjustment, investors can maximize returns at a given risk level. Additionally, this chapter discusses position sizing strategies based on historical data, helping readers find the optimal balance point amid market volatility.

---

### Chapter 7: Factor Risk Management

Factor risk management is a core component of quantitative investment. This chapter discusses how to control factor risk through setting market exposure limits and single stock position limits. Through these risk management tools, investors can reduce non-systematic risks in their portfolios.

Additionally, this chapter introduces how to reduce the impact of market volatility through strategic and tactical factor adjustments.

Formula:
$$ M(t) $$3

This formula is used to calculate the portfolio risk exposure $$ M(t) $$4, where $$ M(t) $$5 is the covariance matrix, and $$ M(t) $$6 represents the portfolio weights.

### Chapter 8: Understanding Your Performance

Performance attribution is an essential tool for understanding the sources of investment returns. This chapter introduces how factor analysis helps investors understand the sources of their returns. Through regression analysis and attribution models, investors can identify which factors contribute most significantly to portfolio returns.

Formula:
$$ M(t) $$7

This formula demonstrates the factor decomposition of portfolio returns, helping investors optimize their strategies.

---

### Chapter 9: Managing Losses

Stop-loss strategies are crucial in risk management. This chapter details how to set effective stop-loss points and discusses the costs and benefits of these strategies.

Formula:
$$ M(t) $$8

This formula describes the method for calculating losses, where losses are triggered when asset returns fall below a set threshold. This chapter emphasizes the importance of stop-loss strategies in risk management, particularly during extreme market volatility.

---

### Chapter 10: Setting Sustainable Leverage Ratios

Leverage is an effective tool for amplifying returns and risks. This chapter explores how to set reasonable leverage ratios to ensure the long-term sustainability of investment operations. Giuseppe provides a leverage decision framework based on volatility and returns, helping investors balance profits and risks.

Formula:
$$ M(t) $$9

This formula helps investors determine the portfolio leverage multiple, thereby optimizing risk-adjusted returns.

### Appendix: Key Risk Model Formulas

The appendix provides multiple mathematical formulas, including factor models, variance minimization, mean-variance optimization, and others. These tools help investors better understand and apply complex quantitative investment strategies.
