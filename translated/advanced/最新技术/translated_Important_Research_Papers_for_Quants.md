## A list of foundational research papers for anyone aspiring to or currently working in quantitative analysis.

## Why study research papers?

Unlike many other disciplines in finance, quantitative finance often has a strong **academic flavor**. This means that many of the modern techniques and practices applied in the field originate from innovations in university and other academic institution research laboratories. Therefore, studying **research papers** published by top quantitative finance academic institutions is an extremely valuable activity.

If you're only interested in the latest published quantitative research papers, you can find comprehensive lists on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/archive/q-fin) or [srrn](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/topten/topTenResults.cfm?groupingtype=2&groupingId=203). However, if you're looking for a curated list of the **most important quantitative finance research papers** as an introduction, that's exactly what this article will cover. We'll share the most influential papers in the field, from the introduction of the **French Fama** model to the classic **Black Scholes** model.

## Paper #1 - [What Happened to the Quants in August 2007?](https://web.mit.edu/Alo/www/Papers/august07.pdf)
This paper details the major events that shook the hedge fund industry during the week of August 6th. During this period, many quantitative hedge funds experienced unprecedented losses, primarily due to their widespread use of **long-short equity strategies** (i.e., short selling operations). Within this week, market speculation suggested that several quantitative portfolios were suddenly liquidated, putting enormous pressure on long-short strategies. In-depth research revealed that systemic risk in the quantitative industry may have been gradually increasing in recent years.

## Paper #2 - [The Cross-Section of Expected Stock Returns](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/media/3775518/the_cross-section_of_expected_stock_returns.pdf)

In this paper, Fama reveals how to capture cross-sectional differences in average stock returns using **size and book-to-market ratios**. Through multivariate linear regression analysis, it demonstrates the multidimensional nature of stock risk. This finding is significant for investors, helping them understand how to use different characteristics to predict expected stock returns.

## Paper #3 - [A Five-Factor Asset Pricing Model](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/programs/sites/programs/files/finance/Finance%20Seminar/spring%202014/ken%20french.pdf)

In this paper, Fama proposes a new financial model aimed at improving the three-factor model introduced in 1993. The model strives to **capture the effects of size, value, quality, profitability, and investment patterns on average stock returns**. Overall, the model not only better explains stock returns but also reduces uncertainty in predictions. Although this model is an improvement on its predecessor, its shortcoming lies in its inability to fully reflect the low average returns of small-cap stocks. In general, this paper provides an important framework for future quantitative analysts in dealing with average return modeling.

## Paper #4 - [The Statistics of Sharpe Ratios](https://alo.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Statistics-of-Sharpe-Ratios.pdf)

The **Sharpe ratio** is a widely used metric for evaluating portfolio performance, with its core being the comparison of investment returns to potential risks. In this paper, Lo delves into the statistical distribution of the Sharpe ratio, exploring whether its measurement is accurate. The study finds that due to autocorrelation with monthly returns, hedge funds' annual Sharpe ratios may be overestimated by up to 65%. Additionally, adjusting the calculation method of the Sharpe ratio significantly affects the ranking of different portfolio strategies.

## Paper #5 - [Optimal Execution of Portfolio Transactions](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Optimal-execution-of-portfolio-trans-actions-Almgren-Chriss/4ea1885d7f00dc2ba59be2d6cc62923de23599ce?p2df)

This paper is one of the early explorations in the field of **portfolio optimization**. Almgren and Chriss focus on how to execute portfolio transactions to minimize transaction costs arising from volatility risk and market impact. Portfolio transactions refer to trades that adjust a portfolio from one state to another within a specific time frame. This strategy typically also involves minimizing **Value at Risk (VAR)** and maximizing the expected return of the trade.

## Paper #6 - [The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos323/papers/black_scholes73.pdf)
This paper first introduces the famous **Black-Scholes model** - a mathematical model for estimating the base price of options through other investment tools and factors. The inspiration for this model came from a simple observation: if options are priced accurately, neither long nor short positions should profit. The model requires five key parameters: strike price, current stock price, time to expiration, risk-free rate, and volatility.

## Paper #7 - [Drift-independent Volatility Estimation Based on High, Low, Open, and Close Prices](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=229190)

This paper introduces the **GARCH model** - a volatility estimation method that comprehensively considers high, low, open, and close prices in historical data. The highlight of this model is that it allows users to incorporate more real-world factors when predicting the expected returns of financial instruments. Compared to traditional estimation methods, this model not only improves prediction accuracy but also demonstrates minimal prediction variance.
