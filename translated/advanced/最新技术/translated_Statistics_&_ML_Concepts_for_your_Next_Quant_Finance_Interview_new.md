Statistics and machine learning occupy a crucial position in quantitative finance interviews. While the depth of examination of these concepts may vary depending on different positions such as quantitative researcher, trader, or developer roles, mastering their fundamental knowledge ensures you can handle the interview with confidence.

In this article, we will explore six core concepts in statistics and machine learning, and demonstrate their practical applications through examples.

## 1. Classification Model Evaluation Metrics

At first glance, accuracy might seem like the best choice when evaluating classification models. However, when data exhibits class imbalance (where one class significantly outnumbers another), we need to consider several other evaluation metrics.

- **Precision:** Measures the accuracy of positive class predictions. Its mathematical expression is:

(True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives)

Precision becomes a crucial metric when the risk of false positives is extremely high. For example, in spam email filtering, we don't want to misclassify important emails as spam, preventing recipients from missing critical information.

- **Recall:** Evaluates the model's ability to identify positive classes. Its mathematical expression is:
(True Positives) / (True Positives + False Negatives)

Recall becomes a significant metric when the cost of false negatives is extremely high. In cancer detection, for instance, false negatives mean patients might miss treatment opportunities, which is highly detrimental to their health.

Similar to many concepts in statistics, there's a trade-off between precision and recall. Improving precision often leads to decreased recall. This trade-off can be visualized through the ROC curve. The ROC curve depicts the relationship between the true positive rate and false positive rate at different thresholds. We want this curve to extend as much as possible toward the upper left corner and maximize the area under the curve.

Our goal is typically to maximize the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate. A simple approach is to increase the number of observations predicted as positive class, ensuring we capture all true positives. However, this also increases the risk of misclassifying negative samples as positive (i.e., false positives). Therefore, we need to capture true positives while avoiding excessive misclassification of negative samples. In some cases, we can accept some misclassifications as long as we ensure capturing all positive samples. The advantage of the ROC curve is that it helps us determine the optimal threshold to achieve this goal.

## 2. Linear Regression
Linear regression is a supervised machine learning method that predicts dependent variables through a set of independent variables. Our goal is to find the coefficients that best fit the data by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values in the linear regression model). In simple linear regression, we have an intercept B0 and a slope B1, where B1 represents the change in the response variable for each one-unit increase in X.  
Linear regression is based on the following assumptions:

1. There exists a linear relationship between predictor variables and response variables

2. No correlation between error terms (errors are independent)

3. Constant variance of error terms (homoscedasticity)

4. Error terms follow normal distribution

5. No multicollinearity

We can verify the first three assumptions by plotting residuals against fitted values in a scatter plot. In the plot, we want to see no obvious patterns to avoid violating assumptions. The normality of error terms can be verified through the Shapiro-Wilk test or Q-Q plots. Finally, multicollinearity can be checked by calculating the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Generally, VIF values â‰¤10 are considered acceptable.  
Since linear regression is a parametric model (can be explicitly expressed through functions), it is prone to overfitting and can have large prediction bias. To further optimize linear regression, methods such as polynomial regression, regularization, and subset selection can be explored.

## 3. K-Means Clustering
K-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that can partition an input dataset into multiple groups. It is called "unsupervised" because during the training process, the algorithm does not rely on labels (i.e., response variables) for learning. The algorithm first divides the data into K clusters and randomly selects a centroid for each cluster. Then, the algorithm assigns the remaining data points to the nearest cluster, typically measured by Euclidean distance. Subsequently, it updates the centroids by calculating the mean of data points within each cluster. This process repeats continuously until the algorithm converges, meaning the cluster partitions no longer change.

In the K-Means algorithm, we can control the number of clusters generated by selecting the parameter K. One common method for choosing the optimal K value is the "elbow method." The core idea is that the initial few clusters explain most of the variance in the data. By plotting the relationship between K values and explained variance, we can find a critical point where further increasing K no longer significantly reduces the unexplained variance in the data. Please refer to the figure below for more details.

## 4. Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning method suitable for both regression and classification tasks. Ensemble methods improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple models. The core of Random Forest is using decision trees as base models. In classification tasks, decision trees split data to maximize information gain; in regression tasks, decision trees split data to minimize mean squared error. Since individual decision trees are prone to overfitting, Random Forest addresses this issue by introducing "bagging" or "boosting" techniques.

1. **Bagging** is an ensemble learning method that trains multiple base models independently and combines their predictions by averaging the results.

2. **Boosting** is also an ensemble learning method, but it builds base models sequentially, with each new model further optimizing predictions based on the previous model.

If you want to learn more about Bagging and Boosting, you can refer to "Adaptive Boosting" and "Gradient Boosting" methods.

## 5. Principal Component Analysis

PCA is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique that can effectively reduce the number of features in a dataset. Its core objective is to summarize the original data using a smaller set of representative variables that can explain most of the variation in the data. PCA is commonly used to reduce model complexity, thereby mitigating overfitting problems. Additionally, it can address the "curse of dimensionality," which occurs when the amount of data is far smaller than the dimensionality of the feature space. Furthermore, PCA can serve as a data visualization tool by projecting high-dimensional data onto a two-dimensional plane.

There are two main methods of principal component analysis: standard PCA and incremental PCA. Standard PCA is the default algorithm, suitable for datasets that can be fully loaded into memory. When the data volume is too large to load entirely into memory, incremental PCA is typically used.
To evaluate the effectiveness of PCA in specific scenarios, we can use the following approach: build machine learning models using the principal components, assess their performance, and compare it with the performance of models that include all features. Ideally, we want the performance of both approaches to be similar. Since PCA aims to explain most of the data variability while reducing the number of features, similar performance indicates that PCA is effective in this scenario.

## 6. Cross Validation

Cross validation is a technique used to evaluate machine learning model performance, primarily focusing on the model's generalization ability to new datasets. There are several methods of cross validation, and we will introduce some of them below.

1. Validation Set Strategy

In this strategy, we divide the dataset into training and validation sets. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set. The disadvantages of this method include:
   - Validation error may fluctuate significantly due to randomly generated training and validation sets.
   - Validation error may overestimate test error because the model might be trained on too few samples (i.e., training set is too small).
2. Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)

In LOOCV, a single sample is used for validation while the remaining samples are used for training. In other words, if there are n samples, n-1 are used for training and 1 for validation. This process is repeated n times, resulting in n squared errors, and the final LOOCV is the average of these errors. The advantages of this method include:
   - Significantly reduced bias compared to the validation set strategy.
   - No limitation on the amount of data available for training the model.
- However, the disadvantage of this method is that the process needs to run n times, making it computationally infeasible for very large datasets.
3. K-Fold Cross Validation

In K-fold cross validation, we randomly divide the data into K folds of approximately equal size. The first fold serves as the validation set, and the model is trained on the remaining K-1 folds. We repeat this process K times, rotating different folds as the validation set. Finally, we obtain K errors and take their average as the cross-validation score. The advantages of this method are:
   - More computationally feasible

   - More accurate test error estimation due to less overlap in training sets between runs.
