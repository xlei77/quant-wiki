# This strategy is very flexible. Investors could use stocks, funds, or ETFs as an investment vehicle. We show simple trading rules for a sample strategy
# from the source research paper. The investor uses two Vanguard funds as his investment vehicles â€“ one equity fund (VFINX) and one government bond
from AlgorithmImports import *

# fund (VUSTX). These two funds have a negative correlation as they are proxies for two negatively correlated asset classes. The investor looks at the
# performance of the two funds over the prior quarter and buys the fund that has a higher return during the ranking period. The position is held for one
# quarter (the investment period). At the end of the investment period, the cycle is repeated.
