# https://quantpedia.com/strategies/return-asymmetry-effect-in-commodity-futures/
#
# The investment universe consists of 22 commodity futures, namely:
# soybean oil, corn, cocoa, cotton, feeder cattle, gold, copper, heating oil, coffee, live cattle, lean hogs,
# natural gas, oats, orange juice, palladium, platinum, soybean, sugar, silver, soybean meal, wheat, and crude oil.
# Firstly, at the beginning of each month, construct the asymmetry measure (IE) for each commodity based on the latest 260 daily returns using the following formula
# (the formula originally consists of theoretical density and integrals, however the solution is simple when empirical distribution is utilized):
# IE = (number of trading days when the daily return is greater than the average plus two standard deviations) â€“ 
# (number of trading days when the daily return is smaller than the average minus two standard deviations).
# Then rank the commodities according to their IE.
# Buy the bottom seven commodities with the lowest IE in the previous month and sell the top seven commodities with the highest IE in the previous month.
# Weigh the portfolio equally and rebalance monthly.
#
# QC Implementation:
#   - Universe consists of Quantpedia comodity futures.
#   - Buying bottom 7 commodities and selling top 7 commodities according to IE.
