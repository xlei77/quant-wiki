# Citadel, Millennium, or Others? Unveiling the Internal Culture of Different Multi-Strategy Hedge Funds

Once, the gold standard in finance was **Goldman Sachs**. Later, it was hedge funds established by talented individual managers like Paul Marshall (*the British hedge fund manager who is now trying to become a media mogul*). Today, it's the era of large multi-strategy hedge funds.

By 2024, multi-strategy funds have become the most prestigious and often most lucrative workplaces in finance. They're expanding rapidly: some of the largest funds (by size) - Millennium, Citadel, Point72, and Balyasny - now collectively employ 11,595 people. However, if you regularly read these pages, you'll know that working at each fund can be an entirely different experience.

People working at these largest funds tend to be secretive. Like banks, large funds are keen on carefully crafting their image. They don't like talking about their current or former employees, nor do they like loose-lipped headhunters. Therefore, the information in this article comes from **non-public** sources.

"All these funds are very different," says a New York headhunter who works with large multi-strategy funds. "They have different DNA and operate differently." A London headhunter agrees: "These places aren't cookie-cutter," he says. "They all have their quirks and characteristics. The differences between teams can be as great as the differences between firms."

As hedge funds grow and recruit, perceptions of their culture become increasingly important. Every fund is chasing the best portfolio managers. Nobody wants to work in a toxic environment.

The pioneer of multi-strategy hedge funds is Ken Griffin of Citadel. Thirty years ago, Griffin had the idea of creating a fund with multiple investment teams, each using different strategies, with the goal of keeping the entire fund market-neutral. "The multi-strategy fund structure is designed to minimize volatility each month. It's a market-neutral multi-manager platform," says an insider.

Will England, CEO and Co-CIO of Walleye Capital, a $5 billion fund in Minnesota that's transforming itself into a multi-strategy fund, describes multi-strategy funds as (ideally) "pure alpha machines." All their costs are passed on to investors. They combine various types of strategies, including "long-short stock selection from both fundamental and quantitative perspectives, various forms of macro strategies, various forms of volatility trading," to pursue profits regardless of whether markets go up or down.

Under these constraints, some things are obvious. If you suffer massive losses, you won't survive. But there are also some variations on this foundation.

## Investment Teams: Autonomy and Centralization

Insiders say the biggest difference, especially between the two major funds Citadel and Millennium, lies in the autonomy of investment teams. Citadel is relatively centralized; Millennium is not.

An insider says: "At Millennium, it's like running your own mini hedge fund, and your experience can vary greatly depending on the investment team. At Citadel, you're joining Citadel. The experience is more uniform. Citadel has a formula that you need to follow."

However, Citadel is known to operate less in silos than other funds, where people are encouraged to share ideas across the firm. In contrast, Millennium gives its portfolio managers autonomy to follow their own strategies, though collaboration occurs when necessary.

A headhunter says: "Millennium's investment teams are very unique. If you join a large established team like Numerus Partners, your experience will be completely different from joining a smaller team."

Due to Millennium's investment teams operating autonomously, there are complaints about teams competing with each other. A headhunter claims: "They have teams doing similar things. If five are making money and two are losing money, they'll cut the two."

## Technology, or Lack Thereof

As Walleye's England points out, the best portfolio managers don't need ping pong tables. They're not interested in funds that offer ping pong tables or "fancy things." When portfolio managers choose employers, what they want are the technology and data platforms that enable them to make money.

This is what Citadel and Millennium excel at. It's why Millennium built a technology center in Miami. It's why Citadel has a project called NXT to recruit experienced engineers. It's what other funds try to replicate—sometimes unsuccessfully. And it's why systematic quant managers leave funds where the technology is subpar.

It's not just about trading systems. Citadel's technology is used to run its centralized proprietary risk factor model, led by Chief Risk Officer Joanna Welsh. The model is visualized on a 35-foot by 8-foot screen, showing stress test results, performance, and risk analytics to form a complete narrative. Earlier this month, Ken Griffin said that Citadel was built on research that was "largely driven by quantitative analytics that weren't commonly used at the time." Today, he says, Citadel supplements these decades of analytics with "deep fundamental research" by "talented market specialists."

None of this technology comes cheap. When you join a pod as a portfolio manager, a key factor is the extent to which you access and pay for central technology resources, or build your own tech. This is crucial in determining profit and loss.

## Stop Loss: Hard or Flexible

Another key distinction is how funds handle losses and violations of risk limits. In this respect, some funds may be stricter than others.

Millennium is notorious for suddenly terminating underperforming portfolio managers, although some consider this an "outdated misconception" of the situation there. Similarly, smaller competitor Eisler Capital has been criticized for its lack of tolerance for losses, though Eisler's COO Chris Milner says this is unfair. "Risk limits are a source of discussion, not gilded cages," Milner told us. "It's about someone's process, whether they followed that process, and whether the results were predictable given their circumstances. Some people have hit or come very close to their stop losses, but we understand their process and believe in their strategy. We let them take a break and then reload."

Some hedge funds are known for their tolerance. Brevan Howard, managing $34 billion in assets, has higher tolerance for stop losses and doesn't immediately fire traders who breach them. This benefits from CEO Aron Landy being Brevan's former Chief Risk Officer. The team led by current CRO Alex Assouline works with traders and guides them when issues arise, rather than suddenly terminating them when losses occur.

Schonfeld, a distressed hedge fund considering partnership with Millennium, is known for its lenient approach. Schonfeld's CEO Ryan Tolkin stated four years ago: "Some of our most successful portfolio managers might have been fired by competitors because they struggled initially." Whether this approach will continue under the partnership with Millennium remains to be seen.

## Develop New Talent or Hire Externally

Funds' different tolerance levels for losses are partly due to their sunk costs. Some funds develop new talent and "invest" in turning them into portfolio managers; others directly recruit seasoned professionals.

Point72, the hedge fund founded by Steve Cohen, is at the forefront of training. Cohen himself describes his strategy as building rather than buying champions. While many hedge funds have graduate training programs and internships, Point72's Academy program is one of the most sophisticated. For this reason, Chief Investment Officer Harry Schwefel says they won't discard junior portfolio managers just for making mistakes: "We don't put them in binary outcomes where they're out if they lose money in their early years because they're still finding their way." A headhunter notes this is Point72's biggest differentiator: "They want most of their portfolio managers to have come up through junior positions."

Similarly, Citadel places heavy emphasis on graduate training, recruiting only the very best newcomers. One source complains: "It's more elitist, requires more tests, which creates a more arrogant culture." But if you're good enough, they'll promote you quickly. Another source says: "Citadel wants you to take risk quickly." Nearly 50% of Citadel's portfolio managers started as assistants or analysts within the firm; half of the business heads in its investment business were developed internally.

At Balyasny Asset Management, Dmitry Balyasny says he hires people with a few years of experience elsewhere and develops them into portfolio managers within two years. "Usually, they know how to pick stocks but don't know how to construct portfolios. They might not have much trading experience. They might not have managed many people before. So we mentor them in all these areas."

Headhunters say smaller funds like Verition and Walleye hire junior portfolio managers and "give them a huge account." This contrasts with Millennium, which reportedly prefers seasoned portfolio managers with "ten years of experience."

## Personnel Turnover

All multi-strategy funds have a tendency to lay off staff when they exceed loss limits, but some funds have a bigger reputation for this than others. One headhunter says: "If you underperform, both Citadel and Millennium will let you go." Both funds would deny that they do this unfairly.

Citadel is sometimes portrayed as having a harsh culture. Comments on the forum site Blind gave it only two stars for culture, complaining about stress and pressure, although 92% of employees in the namesake survey indicated it was a great place to work. Millennium doesn't have similar Blind data. However, both firms have employees with long tenures. At Citadel, the management team's average tenure exceeds 10 years.

When portfolio managers leave, funds need to urgently recruit new talent to deploy assets. As a result, competition for talent is exceptionally fierce.

## Smaller and Friendlier

There's no such thing as a friendly multi-strategy hedge fund, but if you're looking for a friendlier environment, insiders suggest considering smaller funds like Walleye and Verition. A portfolio manager at Verition says, "Verition has a very humble culture. They're extremely supportive of their people."

However, it ultimately comes down to personal preference. A headhunter says, "When you dig into the culture, the question becomes whether you like the personalities of these people. In the hedge fund world, you'll always hear gossip."

As funds work to smooth out their rougher edges, a new type of multi-strategy manager might emerge in the mold of Bobby Jain, former co-Chief Investment Officer at Millennium. Jain is seen more as a risk manager and organizer rather than a risk taker. He's currently hiring for his new multi-strategy fund, Jain Global, which is expected to launch next year. However, after seven years at Millennium, Jain's approach is unlikely to be dramatically different from others.
