## Preface

AI is a hot topic among hedge funds in 2024, with many prominent hedge funds actively positioning themselves in artificial intelligence applications. Looking ahead to 2025, based on industry intelligence, **LLMQuant** has compiled a list of hedge funds that warrant special attention in 2025. These include Walleye Capital, Lone Pine, Renaissance Technologies, and new funds associated with OpenAI.

The hedge fund industry showed strong performance in 2024, but "middle-class" funds face increasing operational pressures. Despite the industry managing trillions of dollars in assets and having dozens of billionaires, many major investors continue to push for cost control. According to industry tracker PivotalPath, hedge funds achieved an average return of over 10% through November 2024. Nevertheless, the average fund still failed to match the S&P 500 index, which is poised to rise over 20% for the second consecutive year. The market remained relatively stable amid volatility surrounding Trump's potential re-election, with some top managers still able to charge astonishing fees and demand lock-up periods lasting several years.

However, like any other industry, the hedge fund sector is increasingly showing a trend where "the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker." After conversations with dozens of industry insiders, we've compiled a list of the 10 most noteworthy hedge funds for 2025. These funds include established giants, startup funds, managers in distress, and those focused on overseas markets.

## 1. Walleye Capital

![Walleye Capital Logo](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/bucketio/img10@main/2024/12/31/1735693242915-2391e0b8-861f-4394-928c-d0ef0c831a16.png)

> **Assets Under Management: $7.4 billion**  
> **Founder: Will England**  

Walleye Capital aims to become the leader among mid-sized multi-strategy funds in the industry. In mid-2024, the fund underwent a major reorganization, attracting several star talents from larger hedge funds, including former Citadel executives and investors Matt Giannini and Rory Murphy, former ExodusPoint market expansion head Anil Jethanandani, former Balyasny portfolio manager Anil Gondi, and WorldQuant's options head Rupert Graham. Meanwhile, some leadership members departed the fund, including macro and fixed income team head Raj Sethi, and Anuraj Dua, who previously managed part of the firm's systematic macro business.

Walleye's ambitions continue to grow. The fund, which originated in Minnesota and initially focused on options market making, now has offices across the United States as well as in London and Dubai, with former Citadel executive Tom DeAngelis serving as president. The fund performed exceptionally well in 2024, achieving a return of 15.4% as of November, and is expected to continue attracting market attention in 2025.

## 2. Pinpoint Asset Management

The Asian hedge fund market has shown strong performance, with many new funds emerging in Singapore and Hong Kong. Numerous fund managers who previously worked at large multi-strategy institutions like Millennium have established their own management companies. Meanwhile, regional players like Dymon Asia are also expanding. However, while many Asian funds either focus on Japanese or Korean markets or look westward toward the Middle East, Pinpoint openly emphasizes its focus on the Chinese market.

Pinpoint is headquartered in Hong Kong with an office in Shanghai. As of November 2024, the firm's $1.2 billion multi-strategy product achieved an 8.6% return this year, marking its best annual performance since 2020. Even more noteworthy is their China-focused product, which is currently soft-closed and has gained 17.3% year-to-date through November (according to HSBC's Hedge Weekly report). Pinpoint believes their expertise in the Chinese market will be a crucial competitive advantage in 2025.

## 3. Viking Global Investors

> **Assets Under Management: $48 billion**  
> **Founder & CEO: Andreas Halvorsen**  

Viking Global has once again experienced leadership changes. The long/short equity fund, founded by billionaire co-founder Andreas Halvorsen, has seen four Chief Investment Officers (CIOs) or co-CIOs depart since 2015, with the most recent being Ning Jin, who left in August this year.

However, Viking has repeatedly proven its ability to quickly develop new investment teams after executive departures and maintain normal operations. As Ning Jin follows the path of his Viking predecessors in establishing his own venture, Viking's performance in 2024 remains impressive, recording a 12.2% return as of November. Meanwhile, the firm has appointed portfolio manager Justin Walsh as its newest CIO. According to his speech at Harvard Business School this year, his biggest concern is the risk of some kind of multi-strategy "systemic collapse."

## 4. Eisler Capital

> **Assets Under Management: $4 billion**  
> **Founder: Ed Eisler**  

Ed Eisler's eponymous hedge fund has failed to keep pace with most multi-strategy funds in 2024. While many competitors are expected to achieve returns of around 10% (or even higher), Eisler is likely to end the year with less than 5% returns. According to a person close to the fund, their year-to-date returns as of November were just above 2%.

This is not due to a lack of effort. Another person familiar with the fund revealed that Eisler had required fund managers to be "fully invested" this year, even when suitable opportunities were not always available. A temporary poor performance doesn't necessarily mean the fund is destined to fail. Schonfeld's turnaround proves that a fund can potentially rejoin the top ranks with just a period of stellar performance. Whether Eisler can stage a comeback in 2025 remains to be tested by the market.

## 5. Marshall Wace Asset Management

> **Assets Under Management: $70 billion**  
> **Co-founders: Paul Marshall, Ian Wace**  

As one of London's top hedge funds, Marshall Wace continues its path toward "institutionalization" in 2024. The firm spares no effort in the "talent war," and despite its co-founders' public opposition to excessive compensation, it continues to poach talent from competitors and has added a "Talent Surcharge" on top of its existing management fees.

This move has brought challenges internally, with some integration issues between new employees and existing teams. However, Marshall Wace's foundation remains fundamentally solid. The firm continues its expansion in the Middle East, establishing a new office in Abu Dhabi and recruiting a portfolio manager from Citadel. According to informed sources, Marshall Wace's flagship multi-strategy product Eureka has gained 14.5% through the end of October.

## 6. Situational Awareness LP

> **Founder: Leopold Aschenbrenner** (former OpenAI employee)

A new hedge fund based in San Francisco is set to officially launch in the new year, backed by heavyweight Silicon Valley teams and funding. Its founder, Leopold Aschenbrenner, previously worked at OpenAI and graduated from Columbia University at age 19. He will use AI technology for investing and has secured funding from prominent Silicon Valley figures including Stripe co-founders Patrick and John Collison, former Y Combinator partner Daniel Gross, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.

This hedge fund, named "Situational Awareness," derives its name from Aschenbrenner's early series of blog posts focusing on AI's potential massive impact. In the highly competitive hedge fund industry, this will serve as an excellent test of whether a "pure AI" fund can succeed.

## 7. Ilex Capital

The biggest new fund debut of 2024 - the new fund established by former UBS and Credit Suisse co-head Bobby Jain - hasn't performed as expected. However, another high-profile new fund established in 2023 has been sailing smoothly, attracting new capital.

Ilex Capital, founded in London by former Citadel employees Jonas Diedrich and Dave Sutton, positions itself as an equity multi-strategy fund. By the end of this year, the fund's assets under management will exceed $3 billion, having raised an additional $1.5 billion compared to last year. Like Taula Capital, established by former Millennium portfolio manager Diego Megia, Ilex is one of the most prominent new funds to spin off from large multi-strategy firms in recent years.

For giants like Millennium, who are constantly seeking new investment channels to handle their increasingly massive capital scale, collaborating with funds established by former employees is also an exciting option.

## 8. Lone Pine Capital

> **Assets Under Management: $16 billion**  
> **Founder: Steve Mandel (retired)**  

Lone Pine Capital, one of the original "Tiger Cubs" funds, is regaining its momentum. Its long/short hedge fund Cypress rose 9% in November alone, bringing its year-to-date returns to 34.3%.

Beyond strong investment returns, Lone Pine is also continuously investing in its business operations, including building up its marketing and institutional relationships. Following founder Steve Mandel's retirement five years ago and star manager Mala Gaonkar's departure in 2022, the 27-year-old Connecticut-based fund experienced a period of turbulence and capital outflows. To turn things around, Lone Pine has focused on improving performance over the past two years and established a business development department for the first time in the company's history: hiring Pat Cronin as Head of Business Development in 2022, completely upgrading their website, and even participating in the iConnections conference in Miami this January to meet potential investors.

While some funds fade away after their founders step back, Lone Pine has chosen to accelerate its development and has delivered impressive performance for two consecutive years.

## 9. Renaissance Technologies

![Jim Simons](https://news.stonybrook.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jim-simons-remembering.jpg)

> **Founder: Jim Simons (deceased)**  
> **Signature Product: Medallion Fund (only open to internal employees)**  

This legendary quantitative fund has long been gradually transitioned from founder Jim Simons to the next generation of management, but Simons' passing in May this year marked a significant milestone for the fund. Renaissance is renowned for its employee-exclusive Medallion Fund, which has consistently maintained extraordinary returns.

After experiencing mediocre performance and partial redemptions in its largest external-facing products in recent years, 2024 saw a rebound. According to sources, Renaissance's largest external product achieved returns of approximately 24% through November this year. Unlike quantitative peers such as Two Sigma and D.E. Shaw, Renaissance has not ventured into non-quantitative strategies. 2024 marks the first year this Long Island-based quantitative giant has operated without its legendary founder, and whether it can maintain its brilliance remains worth watching.

## 10. Whale Rock Capital Management

> **Assets Under Management: $9 billion**  
> **Founder: Alex Sacerdote**  

Boston-based Whale Rock has experienced several "roller coaster" rides in recent years. After suffering a 40% decline in 2021 and another 9% drop in 2022, the fund surged 32% in 2023. This year, Whale Rock has once again reached new "heights," with its flagship fund up 51% as of November.

Whale Rock's portfolio is highly focused on technology stocks, including both prominent U.S. tech companies and some overseas "high-potential" stocks. According to the latest reports, Sacerdote's fund plans to reopen to external investors, targeting to raise $200-300 million. For this $9 billion fund, this also reflects their optimism and continued commitment to future technology market trends.
