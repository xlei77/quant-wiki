# Does Larger Size Mean Better Performance? On the Relationship Between Hedge Fund Size and Performance

There is substantial academic and practical evidence showing that increasing assets under management has a negative impact on long-only funds' performance. For example, a widely cited research paper by Jeffrey A. Busse et al. concluded that larger long-only funds underperform their smaller peers, primarily because they hold fewer small-cap stocks. From a practical perspective, Warren Buffett eloquently illustrated this point in his 2003 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders:

> "Investment managers have far more to gain from asset gathering than from good performance. So when someone tells you that increased funds won't hurt his investment performance, step back: his nose is about to grow longer."

The reasons why increasing assets might hinder performance are logical: as assets grow, investment options narrow, larger managers are restricted to the most liquid investments, and it becomes harder to trade positions flexibly. Smaller stocks offer the potential to discover unknown "gems" because they are less researched by professional investors. Again quoting Buffett from a 1999 Business Week interview:

> "If I was running $1 million today, or $10 million for that matter, I'd be fully invested. I'd have the highest rates of return of my life in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. But I was investing peanuts then. It's a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I could make 50% a year."

Meanwhile, trading offers the possibility of making money from both "process" and "outcome," particularly during periods of market stress when the ability to quickly exit positions may be especially valued.

But do these diseconomies of scale also apply to hedge funds? After all, hedge fund managers often pride themselves on being different and don't necessarily follow conventions. Perhaps the fee structure of hedge funds, charging both performance and management fees, creates greater discipline around asset gathering incentives compared to long-only funds that only charge management fees. Furthermore, research on size and long-only fund performance often focuses on equity funds, while hedge funds invest across asset classes.

## Growth of the Hedge Fund Industry

Before addressing the main issues, it's worth considering the growth of the hedge fund industry in recent years, particularly in relation to fund size. The number of active hedge funds more than doubled between 2010 and 2018, increasing from approximately 1,700 to 3,800. Similarly, the assets managed by these funds more than doubled during this period, growing from $1.4 trillion to $3.2 trillion.

The number of funds and managed assets are divided into five size categories: less than $50 million; $50 million to $250 million; $250 million to $1 billion; $1 billion to $5 billion; and greater than $5 billion. These categories are similar to micro-cap, small-cap, mid-cap, large-cap, and mega-cap in stocks, and are labeled similarly throughout this article.

Interestingly, while the industry has seen significant growth in recent years, the overall composition of the industry has remained remarkably stable in terms of fund size. This applies to both the proportion of funds in each size category and the assets managed by funds. For example, considering the largest size category, funds with assets exceeding $5 billion represented 3.5% of total funds in 2010 and 3.1% in 2018, while representing 41.0% of assets in 2010 and 41.5% in 2018.

This trend is quite surprising and somewhat counterintuitive. Given the significant growth of the entire hedge fund industry, it would not be unreasonable to expect larger size categories to grow more than smaller ones. However, the industry's size structure has remained very stable, with growth being fairly uniform across all size categories.

## Scale and Hedge Fund Performance

Returning to the main question of how scale affects hedge fund performance, the chart below shows the average annual returns for five size categories over the past nine years. While there are notable differences each year, the overall trend is visible: smaller funds outperform their larger peers, with the "micro" group averaging 7.7% annual returns, compared to 6.6% for "small," 5.7% for "medium," 5.6% for "large," and 5.1% for "mega" funds.

While there is a clear trend, the magnitude of return differences may not be as large as expected, particularly for funds with assets above $250 million, which represents a practical threshold given institutional investors' typically larger asset base and higher operational standards. The average annual excess return of the $250 million to $1 billion category relative to the >$5 billion category is relatively modest at 0.6% (5.7% versus 5.1%).

Why might the scale effect not be as pronounced as initially imagined? Perhaps in the case of hedge funds, the presence of performance fees does impose some discipline on asset gathering. Additionally, hedge funds' raison d'être is largely to participate in smaller, more niche markets, which may make hedge fund managers more sensitive to capacity constraints. Furthermore, some larger funds consist of multiple (in some cases hundreds of) underlying portfolio managers, so theoretically can be viewed as a collection of smaller funds. The founder of a large, prominent multi-strategy fund compared his fund to a fleet of small, nimble boats, in contrast to a large ship that's difficult to turn. It's also worth noting that while subject to investment diseconomies of scale, larger funds typically enjoy operational economies of scale, for example in technology and infrastructure, regulation and compliance, and financing.

Another interesting feature emerging from the data is that the strength of the size "factor" has notably diminished over the past three years. In fact, during this period, average annual returns across size categories have been quite similar, with parts of the size "curve" actually inverting, as the medium category's average annual return fell below that of the mega category (3.9% versus 4.4%). Is this just a temporary anomaly or a sign of a more enduring trend? It's too early to conclude, but it's something worth monitoring and revisiting. However, it's hard to ignore the parallels with the poor performance of the small-cap factor in equities in recent years. Indeed, there may be causation, as smaller stock funds tend to have greater exposure to small-caps than larger funds.

## Risk

However, returns are only half the story. What about risk? Do funds of different sizes exhibit similar trends in their risk characteristics? To answer this question, we examined volatility and beta exposure to global equities.

In terms of volatility, a clear trend emerges: smaller funds are more volatile than their larger peers, with the "Micro" group showing an average annual volatility of 11.3%, compared to 9.4% for "Small", 8.8% for "Medium", 8.3% for "Large", and 8.0% for "Mega" funds. This trend is also quite consistent, in stark contrast to the weakening trend in returns. Clearly, the higher returns of smaller funds come at the cost of higher volatility.

The situation with equity beta is quite interesting: there exists a "U-shaped" relationship, where the smallest and largest funds exhibit the highest betas, while medium-sized funds show the lowest beta. More specifically, the "Micro" and "Mega" groups have average annual betas of 0.38, while "Small" and "Large" groups show 0.33 and 0.34 respectively, and the "Medium" group shows 0.31.

A possible explanation is that smaller funds run higher market exposure because their managers are less experienced, or because their lower asset base affords them the luxury of trading more aggressively and taking larger risks. Larger funds may also run higher market exposure due to the difficulties of managing hedge portfolios at scale and the long-term nature of such funds. In contrast, medium-sized funds seem to represent a sweet spot where managers may have matured beyond beta exposure, while the fund size is not yet large enough to be constrained by their asset base.

## Return Dispersion

While smaller funds have shown higher returns than their larger peers, what is the range of results within each size group? The following figure shows the standard deviation of annual fund returns (as a measure of variability) across the five size groups. Although there are notable variations each year, the overall trend is very clear: smaller funds exhibit significantly higher return variability than larger funds, with the "micro" group showing an average annual return standard deviation of 16.5%, compared to 13.7% for the "small" group, 11.6% for the "medium" group, 10.6% for the "large" group, and 9.7% for the "mega" group. Note that the return standard deviation of the smallest group is on average 1.7 times higher than that of the largest group (16.5% versus 9.7%).

This trend is not entirely surprising: it is reasonable to assume that there is greater dispersion among smaller funds, as smaller funds tend to be more entrepreneurial and thus generate a wider range of outcomes, while there is less room for differentiation at scale.

While smaller funds offer the greatest potential returns, they also carry the greatest risks, not only in terms of the higher volatility and higher equity beta seen in the previous section but also in terms of higher "execution" risk, given the greater variability in returns. Clearly, there are more opportunities to find "diamonds" among smaller funds (similar to how equity investors often have more opportunities among small-cap stocks), but there is also a greater risk of encountering "duds," thus increasing reputational risk.

## Key Results Summary

The following table summarizes the key results from the above analysis. Note that the table includes Sharpe ratios, which attempt to combine return and volatility statistics (these are derived from the aforementioned return and volatility statistics, using 3-month USD LIBOR as the risk-free rate over the nine-year period). Since Sharpe ratios become meaningless when returns turn negative (as in 2011 and 2018), they are not presented on an annual basis like the other statistics discussed earlier.

While Sharpe ratios show a declining trend as assets increase, this trend is not uniform, and the results suggest that investors seeking to maximize Sharpe ratios might want to target funds with assets between $50 million and $250 million.

| Size Category | Annual Average Return | Annual Average Volatility | Sharpe Ratio |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Micro (<$50M) | 7.7% | 11.3% | 0.49 |
| Small ($50M-$250M) | 6.6% | 9.4% | 0.49 |
| Medium ($250M-$1B) | 5.7% | 8.8% | 0.43 |
| Large ($1B-$5B) | 5.6% | 8.3% | 0.44 |
| Mega (>$5B) | 5.1% | 8.0% | 0.40 |

## Conclusion

Hedge fund managers may take pride in being different, but at least in terms of scale, they are not immune to the well-known diseconomies of scale that affect their long-only peers. Nevertheless, the impact of size on returns is not as significant as one might expect, particularly for funds with assets exceeding $250 million, which is a practical threshold for many institutional allocators. It's also noteworthy that there has been a marked weakening of the size factor over the past three years. Furthermore, while smaller funds offer the greatest potential returns, they also come with greater risks, including higher volatility, equity beta, and return variability. For allocators willing and able to move down the size curve, there are potential returns to be had, but also greater execution and reputational risks. Therefore, robust investment and operational due diligence processes become particularly crucial when considering smaller funds.

In other words, each hedge fund is unique and thus needs to be considered on its own merits, taking into account various factors, both general and specific. However, size is clearly a factor that cannot be ignored. Because, while it may be more of a capybara than an elephant in the room, size is a factor that hedge fund investors should wisely weigh carefully in their allocation decisions.

## Further Research

Do scale factors differ among hedge fund strategies? It's reasonable to assume that certain strategies are more sensitive to asset growth, such as those involving less liquid assets, high leverage, or high turnover. Do returns decline more rapidly with increasing assets for highly leveraged fixed-income relative value funds and high-turnover statistical arbitrage funds? In contrast, strategies involving more liquid assets, such as global macro and CTAs, may be less sensitive to asset growth. In the case of multi-strategy funds, there might even be an inverse relationship, given that operational economies of scale are particularly important for such funds. Further work is needed to dig deeper into the data and examine these relationships.

Another area worthy of further research is the relationship between fund age and performance. Does the hunger for success among "young guns" provide an advantage, or is the experience of "veterans" what truly matters? Since smaller funds tend to be newer, perhaps age rather than size is the real differentiating factor in performance!
