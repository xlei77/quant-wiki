# From $8 Million to $22 Billion: How Julian Robertson Built the Tiger Hedge Fund Dynasty

When Archegos Capital Management's collapse caused over $10 billion in losses across multiple banks, the background of founder Bill Hwang drew significant attention: he was a former member of Tiger Management.

Before his private investment firm's collapse in March this year, Hwang was a relatively unknown figure, better known for pleading guilty to telecommunications fraud charges in 2012. However, industry peers were shocked that he was able to subsequently secure $50 billion in financing from top banks to leverage what would ultimately become failed bets.

## The Influence of Tiger Legacy

Bill Hwang's identity as a former Tiger Fund manager placed him among the hedge fund elite. He worked at Tiger Management in New York from 1996 to 2001, becoming a protégé of Julian Robertson, the hedge fund pioneer of the 1980s. The Archegos disaster highlighted how, even decades after Robertson closed Tiger Fund to outside investors, his so-called "Tiger Cubs" still commanded enough prestige to open doors to the world's most prestigious banks and investors.

"Once you have the Tiger pedigree, it helps convince anyone to do business with you," said a prime broker at a bank that lost money in the Archegos collapse.

## The Success and Exceptions of Tiger Cubs

Hwang's case is an exception. Among this group of managers who have earned billions for their clients, some are now among the world's most respected investors.

"No firm in investment management history has produced more exceptional talent," says Dixon Boardman, CEO of Optima Asset Management, who worked with Robertson at brokerage firm Kidder, Peabody & Co before Robertson founded Tiger in 1980.

## Global Financial Influence of Tiger

Tiger's influence extends throughout the global financial sector. According to data from investor LCH Investments, nearly 200 hedge fund firms can trace their origins back to Tiger Management. They either worked at the original Tiger Fund, were one of approximately 50 companies that Robertson provided seed funding to, or are "Tiger grandchildren" that spun off from these alumni companies. According to LCH, only George Soros's hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, comes close to nurturing such a large number of industry key figures.

Even now, the connections between Robertson and his disciples remain close, and they often hold similar positions. "Bill is my good friend, and I know him well. I think he made a mistake, and I expect he will come out of it and move forward," the 88-year-old Robertson told the Financial Times in a rare interview.

When asked whether Hwang's Tiger background helped him secure substantial bank financing, Robertson said: "I don't know. I can't answer that question." Hwang declined to comment for this article.

## Tiger Fund's Brilliant Performance

Tiger Fund's performance was exceptionally outstanding, beating the U.S. market for 14 consecutive years, benefiting from notable trades such as shorting copper price declines in 1996 or betting on Thai baht depreciation the following year. From 1980 to 2000, it achieved an average annual net return of over 25%. At that time, Robertson returned capital to investors because he refused to participate in the internet stock boom of the late 1990s, and although he lost 19% in 1999, his view was ultimately proven correct.

"To some extent, Julian Robertson influences trillions of dollars in assets under management because there are so many people who have worked for him directly or indirectly," says Daniel Strachman, author of "Julian Robertson: A Tiger in the Land of Bulls and Bears."

## Criticism of Tiger Cubs

Some critics argue that the halo surrounding "Tiger Cubs" has been overstated or has dimmed in recent years, and that some of the methods pioneered by Tiger Management have now become commonplace. For example, many of these managers have recently been bullish on U.S. growth stocks - a consensus trade during periods when monetary easing drove stock market gains.

However, few can question the success of some of the original "Tiger Cubs."

"The success rate of the entire group isn't much different from that of the hedge fund community, but those who have succeeded long-term have achieved extraordinary results and shown resilience in changing markets," says Jim Neumann, Chief Investment Officer at Sussex Partners, a firm that provides hedge fund investment advice to clients.

## Shaping "The King's Table"

Many "Tiger Cubs" remain good friends with each other and maintain connections with Robertson, developing similar investment styles learned from him. It's an apparently simple approach: buy the best companies based on fundamental research and short the worst ones.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Robertson stated that a rigorous recruitment process was key: "I think they were talented people, and we looked for them in a very planned and deliberate way. They were really carefully selected."

Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Capital, suggests that Tiger's focus on recruiting "well-rounded people rather than specialists" was the "secret sauce," creating a culture of competitive, curious, and outgoing individuals.

A key figure in this process was Dr. Aaron Stern, a psychoanalyst who served multiple roles including Chief Operating Officer at the firm for 30 years. Dr. Stern passed away this April at 96; he was a leading expert on narcissistic personality disorder and published the influential book "Me: The Narcissistic American" in 1979.

"Aaron was a great man," Boardman said. "It might be going too far to say he was responsible for Julian's success... but he was the one who picked who should be there, who should sit at the king's table."

In the early 1990s, Robertson used Dr. Stern to develop a systematic approach to replicate Tiger's early success in recruiting talented young analysts, which had previously relied on his intuition. The testing of applicants involved around 450 questions and lasted over three hours.

"He was very important because he really perfected this recruiting technique that we used," Robertson said.

Questions might include the Rorschach inkblot test, originally developed in 1921 to detect mental imbalances. Stern also designed exams to prevent applicants from "gaming" results by providing answers they thought Tiger wanted.

"Some questions were open-ended," said a former portfolio manager who took the test. "Like: Is it more important to get along with the team or to challenge them? Would you rather be intellectually right and lose money, or intellectually wrong but save the trade?"

The aim was to understand applicants' thought processes, risk-taking propensity, and ability to work in teams. The process reflected its era; recruitment was overwhelmingly male, with no notable female members in an industry that remains male-dominated. Nevertheless, the thinking stood out as distinctive. Tiger wasn't just looking for the smartest people, but those who were highly competitive and excelled in areas like sports.

"Once someone has a certain IQ, IQ actually isn't as important to their success as you might imagine," said Alex Robertson, Julian's son and current president of Tiger Management.

## Two Sides of the Coin

Young analysts work alongside more experienced colleagues, learning their skills. Everyone works hard, with some putting in up to 14-hour days and working Saturdays. The firm built a gym on the top floor of its headquarters at 101 Park Avenue, which Julian visits daily to help employees reduce stress.

"We're young and super competitive analysts competing against people who work 7 hours a day and are used to two-martini lunches," says Lee Ainslie, founder of Maverick Capital.

The firm also encourages analysts to informally share and challenge ideas, frequently walking into each other's offices to discuss views on particular stocks. Julian's own office is on the top floor without a door, encouraging employees to bring ideas to him.

"Early on, Julian gave you the ability to focus on honest thinking," says LaFont.

"For anything, he would force you to see both sides of the argument. There would never be zealots - every coin has two sides. If Julian thought you had dismissed the other side of the story, you would be viewed as unprepared because you were considered too narrow or short-sighted in your approach."

Dr. Stern also played a key role in resolving disputes between analysts and explaining how Julian managed the firm. "He was a great solution provider and problem solver," says Alex Robertson. "He made sure everyone stayed together as a team."

## Long-term Perspective

Tiger Management and its "Tiger Cubs" are known for their long-term outlook and deep company research, engaging with customers and competitors to gain additional insights. Robertson's goal was to find the best 20 stocks to buy and the worst 20 stocks to short. Tiger typically used about 100% leverage, meaning total market exposure could reach up to 230%.

While valuation is important, it was often secondary, with factors such as a company's position in the industry and barriers to entry being more crucial. "The investment thesis was never built around whether a company would perform well or poorly in the next quarter," Lafont said. "It was always a long-term focus, with a three-to-five-year time horizon."

Similar approaches have been adopted by "Tiger Cubs" such as Chase Coleman of Tiger Global, Lafont, and Ainslie of Maverick, who invested in technology companies that might appear expensive by traditional valuation metrics but delivered enormous returns. All three expanded into private companies, seeking broader opportunities.

Those who invested when Coleman founded Tiger Technology (now Tiger Global) at age 25 in 2001 may have seen their initial investment grow 43-fold. Coleman noted that Robertson's guidance gave the "Tiger Cubs" confidence to take risks when they identified unique opportunities.

David Goel's low-profile firm Matrix Capital is another example, having reportedly raised only about $1 billion from investors but growing to approximately $7 billion through performance, according to people familiar with the firm.

"Julian Robertson's ability to recruit young analysts, train them in stock investing, and allow them to flourish as spin-off firms is unique, given the success of many 'Tiger Cubs,'" said Pierre-Henri Flamand, senior investment advisor at Man GLG. "This will be his legacy."
