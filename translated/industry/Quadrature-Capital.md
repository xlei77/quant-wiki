# Quadrature Capital: The Mysterious Proprietary Trading Firm You've Never Heard Of

Who is Quadrature Capital? What kind of entity is it exactly? Is it a hedge fund? A high-frequency proprietary trading firm? Or a special vehicle that uses massive profits to address climate crisis?

In this financial world of increasing transparency, **Quadrature** remains exceptionally mysterious and elusive.

## They Don't Respond, or Barely Do

Quadrature Capital remains highly secretive about external inquiries. Despite our multiple attempts to contact them, we received no response. Their official website merely describes themselves briefly as a "technology company" that achieves returns using their own capital through market-neutral trading based on statistical models. However, their latest registration documents show that they provide "investment management services" and charge fees from managed assets.

Market rumors abound: some say they, like XTX, stockpile large numbers of GPUs to power their trading algorithms with AI; others speak of their lavish employee retreats and free-flowing beer in the office; some even jokingly describe the company's internal atmosphere as being like the "Oompa Loompas" (the mysterious small people who devotedly serve the chocolate factory owner in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) - once employees join, they never leave.

But one thing is certain: they pay substantial compensation while making enormous donations to the Quadrature Climate Foundation.

## Undeniable Facts: High Salaries and Environmental Donations

Official documents (reports published by Companies House) show that Quadrature Capital Limited paid an average salary of £2.46 million to its UK-based employees last year. While this is slightly lower than the 2022 peak (£3.6 million), it remains remarkably high.

The company's two billionaire founders, Greg Skinner and Suneil Setiya, did not draw salaries from the company but instead received combined loans of £56.7 million last year through tax-optimized arrangements. Meanwhile, the Quadrature Climate Foundation received donations of £269 million in 2023 and paid an average salary of £293,000 to its 14 employees. Setiya frequently posts on social media, calling for collective action to address climate change. He believes humanity is on a trajectory of "excess emissions" and must immediately reduce emissions.

## The Mysterious Work Environment

While Quadrature's high salaries and environmental aspirations are documented in official papers, their work environment remains shrouded in mystery. Their website praises their "lush and beautiful" office atmosphere. The London office features a large gym and conference rooms styled after "ski chalets," "lakeside retreats," and "beach houses." The Singapore office opened in 2023, while the New York office is set to open in September 2024. Employees enjoy music lessons and free books, along with summer and winter annual trips—whose carbon footprint is reportedly offset through carbon compensation.

However, what actually happens inside the company is subject to various unverified accounts:

- Some say annual trips involve private jets, necessitating more carbon offsets; others in the know claim they're just picnics in nearby parks.
- Some assert that beer is freely available in the office, like WeWork. But another insider says nobody really drinks it.
- More rumors circulate about how mysteriously cautious the company is, with employees carefully adhering to Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).

One insider notes: "Quadrature is somewhat like a 'cult,' and that's intentional. The company treats its employees exceptionally well, with amazing benefits, and many people are willing to stay even for slightly less pay."

## Small but Elite Team

Quadrature is not a behemoth. In comparison, Jane Street has over 2,600 employees and generated $14 billion in net trading revenue in nine months; while Quadrature Capital Limited generated £588 million in revenue with 143 employees in the 12 months leading up to January 2024—a relatively smaller scale.

If you're interested in joining Quadrature, word has it that talent recruitment is in the hands of Ada Offonry. She joined in 2021 to lead talent recruitment and is an advocate for diversity hiring. Quadrature likes to recruit interns, an area managed by Hannah Ewert, who switched from Meta in 2021.

## Talent Mobility: Few Departures

Most people who join Quadrature appear reluctant to leave. However, there are exceptions: for instance, there are unconfirmed rumors of discord between the technology and operations departments. Laurent Mazare, a former Jane Street and DeepMind researcher who joined in June 2023, left after just 4 months (in September 2023). Mike White, former CTO of WorldQuant, joined in May 2023 but departed in October. Whether these departures were due to performance issues or personal fit remains unknown, and Quadrature has shown no interest in explaining.

## Quiet Rise

A veteran quant recalls: "I met them around 2011 when they were just four people working in some basement in the City of London. Within just a few years, they had moved into a high-rise building, acquired numerous employees, and quietly grew substantial."

Quadrature flourished this way in their garden-surrounded office, maintaining an extremely low profile externally. If you're a quantitative researcher, word has it that this is a good choice—high salaries, generous employee benefits, clear environmental protection goals, low turnover, and they've reached a considerable scale while staying largely under the radar.

Perhaps this is precisely their strategy: **to quietly grow larger in their "secret garden" without having to say much to the outside world**.
