## Unveiling the Compensation of Quantitative Traders, Developers, and Researchers

High salaries are undoubtedly one of the key factors attracting people to the financial industry. According to data, portfolio managers earn an average annual salary exceeding $114,000, while professionals in investment banking and accounting also receive considerable compensation, indicating promising economic prospects in this field.

However, there's one branch of finance that often goes unnoticedâ€”quantitative finance. Unlike other financial disciplines, quantitative finance is highly technical, typically involving the use of software programs and mathematical models to capture favorable opportunities in trading markets. Sound interesting? Then get ready to learn about the earnings of these mysterious Wall Street figures. This article will provide a detailed analysis of the compensation for quantitative traders, quantitative researchers, and quantitative developers.

## Quantitative Intern Compensation
Before diving into full-time quantitative analyst salaries, let's look at starting salaries for **interns**. Quantitative firms are constantly seeking top talent and actively taking measures to recruit students from elite institutions. As a quantitative intern, you can work as a trader, developer, or researcher. These internship positions typically offer compensation far higher than software engineering or data science internships. For example, Jane Street's 2023 summer intern compensation was almost double that of Google software engineering interns!

Below is a summary of quantitative finance intern compensation data we collected from Levels.fyi. We've listed the top 10 highest-paying companies - click the link above for more details.

| Company | Hourly Rate | Bonus |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Five Rings | $120 | $15,000 signing bonus |
| D.E Shaw | $110 | $20,000 signing bonus |
| Jump Trading | $100 | $20,000 signing bonus |

As shown above, quantitative intern compensation is quite substantial. For example, Radix Trading's **compensation package equals $144 | $0250,000 - $144 | $1250,000 - $144 | $2200,000 - $144 | $3120,000 - $144 | $4120,000 - $144 | $5120,000 - $144 | $6175,000 - $144 | $7175,000 - $250,000 | [Job Posting](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/careers/job/?gh_jid=2340246&gh_src=b79c7b511us) |

You might notice that these companies share a common trait: **quantitative researchers and traders typically earn similar compensation**. However, developers sometimes earn slightly less than the other two roles. This is mainly because there are far more skilled developers available in the market compared to quantitative researchers and traders.
