# The Medallion Fund: Renaissance Technologies' Unique Money-Making Machine

The **Medallion Fund**, established by Renaissance Technologies exclusively for its quantitative analysts and employees, is renowned as Wall Street's most mysterious black box.

Sixty miles east of Wall Street, a whale-tail-shaped peninsula separates Long Island Sound from Conscience Bay. Here, in a small village called Old Field, mansions with long gated driveways and million-dollar views line the streets. Locals have another name for these wealthy streets: **Renaissance Riviera**.

The wealthiest residents here are almost all scientists who work for Renaissance Technologies in nearby East Setauket. These scientists are the creators and overseers of the Medallion Fund—perhaps the world's greatest money-making machine. The Medallion Fund is open only to Renaissance's roughly 300 employees, about 90 of whom hold Ph.D.s, along with certain individuals closely connected to the firm.

This legendary fund, known for its extreme secrecy, has generated approximately $55 billion in profits over the past 28 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, making about $10 billion more than funds managed by billionaires Ray Dalio and George Soros. Moreover, the Medallion Fund achieved higher profits in less time and with smaller assets under management. The fund almost never loses money, with its largest drawdown over any five-year period being just 0.5%.

Few companies generate as much interest, rumor, or speculation as Renaissance. Everyone has heard of Renaissance, but almost no one knows what happens inside. (The company also operates three public hedge funds managing about $26 billion, though their performance isn't as spectacular as Medallion's.) Besides Jim Simons, who retired in 2009 to focus on philanthropy, little is known about this small group of scientists—whose wealth exceeds the GDP of many nations and who increasingly influence American politics. Renaissance's owners and executives declined to comment on this report through spokesman Jonathan Gasthalter. The following is based on extensive research and interviews with more than twenty people who know them, have worked with them, or competed against them.

Renaissance stands out even among hedge funds, not just for its brilliant employees but also for their quirks. Company co-head Peter Brown typically sleeps on a Murphy bed in his office. His partner Robert Mercer rarely speaks; in meetings, you're more likely to hear him whistle "The Star-Spangled Banner" than hear his voice. Twin scientists seem to produce their best work through fierce arguments. Territory battles aren't uncommon among employees: one power struggle may have given a Russian scientist a larger role in the highly profitable equities business, becoming a battle between old and new guards.

## Employee Rewards and Company Culture

Employees' wealth in Medallion depends on their overall contribution to the company—collaboration is key to gaining more shares. Employees receive stock allocations they can purchase. Additionally, a quarter of their compensation is deferred and invested in Medallion, where funds remain for four years. Employees also pay fees of up to "5 and 44."

From the beginning, Simons determined that the fund's overall size would affect performance: too much money would destroy returns. Renaissance currently limits Medallion's assets to between $9 billion and $10 billion, about twice what it was a decade ago. Profits are distributed every six months.

Thanks to Medallion, Simons—who still owns up to 50% of the company—has a net worth of $15.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Laufer owns the next largest share (potentially up to 25%), while Brown and Mercer are among other employees worth hundreds of millions.

In some ways, money, along with the company's family atmosphere, binds the company together. Apart from those leaving academia or pursuing philanthropy, scientists rarely leave Renaissance. Why do they stay? The problems are complex, colleagues are first-rate, and the pay is excellent.

As everyone got rich from Medallion, lifestyles changed. Train commutes to Manhattan were replaced by helicopter rides. Scientists swapped their Hondas for Porsches. Luxury hobbies became normal. Simons' cousin Robert Lourie, head of futures research, built a riding arena for his daughter with arches so large that bridges to New York City had to be closed at night for transport. They also own yachts. Mercer has commissioned a series of yachts named Sea Owl. Simons' 222-foot Archimedes features wooden fireplaces. Both vessels have such novel propulsion systems that they don't need anchors. As the conductor of merriment, Simons plans company trips—to Bermuda, the Dominican Republic, Florida, Vermont—and encourages employees to bring their families. According to company legend, during one ski trip, Simons, a longtime smoker, bought insurance for a restaurant so he wouldn't have to give up his beloved tobacco.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

However, money also threatens the stability of the family atmosphere. In 2001, Renaissance hired a Russian scientist Alexander Belopolsky, who, like many colleagues, moved west after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Patterson opposed his hiring because he had recently worked on Wall Street and frequently changed jobs. His concerns were quickly validated. In 2003, he and another Russian, Pavel Volfbeyn, announced their departure to hedge fund Millennium Partners, where they negotiated generous bonuses and rights to retain most of their profits. Renaissance sued them and Millennium, fearing these researchers would take away company secrets. The parties later settled privately.

Meanwhile, another Russian-born Renaissance researcher, Alexey Kononenko (who received his Ph.D. from Penn State in 1997 and had briefly worked on Wall Street) was promoted within the equities group. Senior staff in the equities group discussed Kononenko's promotion during a routine dinner. According to one insider, the scientists merely questioned why he was promoted over colleagues who had been with the company longer. But others familiar with the company said Kononenko's promotion was a significant event in Renaissance's history, with the Russian scientist effectively playing a power game.

Regardless of the reasons for Kononenko's promotion, the result protected Renaissance's source of wealth: the Medallion fund has averaged returns of over 40% annually since that dinner.

When competitors and former investors are asked how Renaissance can consistently achieve such remarkable returns, the answer is unanimous: they run faster than anyone else. However, all this running doesn't always keep them standing when others fall.

In August 2016, rising mortgage defaults led several of the largest quantitative hedge funds, including Goldman Sachs managing $30 billion in assets, into trouble. Fund managers were forced to reduce positions, exacerbating market chaos. Insiders say the storm caused the Medallion fund to lose nearly $1 billion in a few days—about one-fifth of the fund. Renaissance executives, worried that continued turmoil would wipe out their own fund, prepared to reduce risk and began selling positions. They almost gave up when the market rebounded, but Medallion ended the year with 85.9% growth, making up for the losses. The executives learned an important lesson: don't interfere with the models.

Another perhaps more important lesson was: beware of damage others might cause. That same month, Simons wrote in a letter to investors in his public institutional equity funds: "While we believe we have an excellent set of predictive signals, some of them are undoubtedly shared by many long-short hedge funds."

No system can last forever, quantitative analysts say. They question how long Medallion's magic can continue. But seven years after Simons' retirement, the fund's profit-making method persists. Even in early 2016, when many hedge funds struggled, it still achieved returns of over 20%. Renaissance's wealth and influence continue to grow rapidly.

## Summary

Renaissance Technologies and its Medallion Fund's ability to stand out in the highly competitive financial markets is inseparable from its top-tier team of scientists, powerful computational capabilities, rich data resources, and extreme attention to detail. Jim Simons' vision and leadership, along with the wisdom and collaboration of team members, have made the Medallion Fund a legend in the financial world. However, with changing market conditions and intensifying competition, whether Renaissance can maintain its leading position remains an open question.

Renaissance's story not only demonstrates the powerful potential of quantitative analysis in finance but also reminds us that the combination of technology and finance requires continuous innovation and adaptation. Looking ahead, as computational technology advances and data science evolves, we await to see how Renaissance and its Medallion Fund will address new challenges and continue to write their legendary story.
