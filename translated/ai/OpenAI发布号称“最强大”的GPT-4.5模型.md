## Use Cases

### 1. Help Users Through Difficult Times

**GPT-4.5:**  
> "It sounds like you're really upset about this exam failure. I understand - this kind of setback can be really demoralizing, but it doesn't define you or your full potential. Would you like to talk about what happened specifically? Or would you prefer some other way to relax? I'm here for either."

**GPT-4o:**  
> Provided 6 practical suggestions, such as "analyzing reasons for failure", "communicating with professors or teachers", "actively seeking support and help", etc., but with a relatively more detached tone.

From this comparison, we can see that GPT-4.5's response places more emphasis on emotional connection, naturally extending an invitation for the user to "share their feelings", demonstrating **higher emotional intelligence (EQ)**.

### 2. Identifying Paintings

**GPT-4.5:**  
> "You must be referring to 'The Burning of the Ships by the Trojan Women' by Claude Lorrain. This painting was created in 1643, depicting the scene of Trojan women setting fire to ships after their exhausting journey, inspired by Virgil's Aeneid."

**GPT-4o:**  
> Referring to the work as 'The Women of Cnidus Burning the Fleet', there are some inaccuracies regarding its specific origin.

GPT-4.5 not only identifies the painting's name more accurately but also provides richer historical context.

### 3. Discussing Space Exploration

**GPT-4.5:**  
> "OpenAI believes that space exploration is not a luxury, but rather an important pathway to help Earth address climate change, resource scarcity, and survival risks. It also brings technological innovation and economic growth, while inspiring humanity to work towards common goals."

**GPT-4o:**  
> Elaborates on the importance and ethical issues of space exploration in greater length, but overall leans more towards information presentation.

GPT-4.5's response is more concise and shows better conversational qualities in expressing emotions and intentions.

## Stronger Reasoning is on the Way

It's worth emphasizing that GPT-4.5 **does not "think first" before answering**; its advantages mainly lie in the broad knowledge gained through unsupervised learning and more precise expression. In contrast, models that focus on reasoning processes, such as OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o3-mini, are better suited for complex STEM problems.

OpenAI believes that as pre-trained models like GPT-4.5 continue to expand in the "knowledge" dimension, this accumulated "world understanding" will lay a solid foundation for introducing reasoning or tool-use capabilities in the future.
