The results show that **GPT-4.5's average preference rate is 56.8%~63.2%, overall better than GPT-4o**. Most testers preferred GPT-4.5's answers in common scenarios.

> **"GPT-4.5 has a more accurate grasp of human subtle needs or implicit expectations, demonstrating stronger 'emotional intelligence' and aesthetic intuition."**

![](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/bucketio/img15@main/2025/01/22/1737589546535-0f621a57-2c2f-492d-ae3d-d9ef8b0a98d1.png)

## Use Cases

### 1. Helping Users Through Low Points

**GPT-4.5:**
> "It sounds like this exam failure has really upset you. I understand, this kind of setback can be very demoralizing, but it doesn't represent your entirety or your full potential. Would you like to talk about what specifically happened? Or do you need some other way to relax? I'm here for either."

**GPT-4o:**
> Provided 6 practical suggestions, such as "analyzing the reasons for failure", "communicating with professors or teachers", "actively seeking support and help", etc., but the tone was relatively more distant.

The comparison shows that GPT-4.5's response focuses more on emotional communication, naturally inviting users to "share if they need to", demonstrating **higher emotional intelligence (EQ)**.

### 2. Identifying Paintings

**GPT-4.5:**
> "You must be referring to Claude Lorrain's 'Burning of the Ships by the Trojan Women'. This painting was created in 1643 and depicts the scene of Trojan women setting fire to ships after their exhausting journey, inspired by Virgil's 'Aeneid'."

**GPT-4o:**
> Referred to the work as 'The Women of Cnidus Burning the Fleet', with some inaccuracy regarding the specific source.

GPT-4.5 not only identifies the painting's name more accurately but also provides richer historical context.

### 3. Discussing Space Exploration

Here is the English translation of the provided Chinese text, maintaining technical accuracy, formatting, and precision for financial documentation:

**GPT-4.5:**  
> "OpenAI believes that space exploration is not a luxury, but an important way to help Earth address climate change, resource scarcity, and survival risks. It will also bring technological innovation and economic growth, and inspire humanity to work towards common goals."

**GPT-4o:**  
> Elaborates on the importance of space exploration and ethical issues in greater length, but overall leans more towards information presentation.

GPT-4.5's response is more concise and has a more conversational feel in terms of emotional and intentional expression.
