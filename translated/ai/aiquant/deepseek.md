# DeepSeek: A Quantitative-Backed Startup "Shorting" U.S. Tech Stocks with Real Strength

Hello everyone, today I'd like to discuss **DeepSeek**, which has recently captured global attention. This Chinese AI research laboratory, founded in **2023** by **Liam Wenfeng**, is launching a powerful challenge to the U.S. tech giants' AI dominance with its open-source **DeepSeek-R1** model. Let's examine what key features have propelled DeepSeek into the global spotlight and triggered such significant waves in the capital markets.

## Breaking News: US Tech Stocks Plunge Significantly!

- **Bloomberg** reports that Nasdaq 100 futures and European Stoxx 600 technology sub-index both fell, wiping out a combined market value of **$1.2 trillion**;  
- The **"Magnificent Seven"** took heavy hits: 

  - Nvidia stock plummeted **-11%**  
  - Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL) -3%  
  - Amazon (AMZN) -2.4%  
  - Meta (META) -1.4%  
  - Microsoft (MSFT) -3.2%  
  - Tesla (TSLA) -0.61%  
  - Apple (AAPL) bucked the trend rising 1.2%, due to the popularity of DeepSeek-related applications in the App Store  
  
- Chip stocks: ASML -6.2%, Broadcom (AVGO) -12%, Qualcomm (QCOM) -1.4%, AMD (AMD) -4.5%

Evidently, DeepSeek's "low hardware requirements" philosophy has put pressure on many chip manufacturers and cloud computing service providers.

## DeepSeek Laboratory and Its Two Major Backgrounds

1. **Founder: Liam Wenfeng**  
   - Besides creating DeepSeek, he also founded **PhantaQuant**, a hedge fund supporting DeepSeek. Evidently, this laboratory was born with dual "finance + technology" DNA.
2. **Initial Breakthrough: DeepSeek V3**  
   - In **December 2024**, DeepSeek released its first open-source LLM—DeepSeek V3, reportedly with a total investment of less than **$6 million**, trained using Nvidia's **H800** chips;  
   - At that time, it already gained recognition in the global AI community with its motto of "high performance, low cost."

## DeepSeek-R1: A New Benchmark for Low-Cost, High-Performance

The **R1** version, further developed by DeepSeek based on **V3**, is regarded as their ace product to directly compete with OpenAI.

### 1. Reinforcement Learning Direct Drive: Breaking Through Conventional SFT
- DeepSeek-R1 relies almost entirely on **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to iterate the model, greatly reducing dependency on manually annotated data;  
- RL enables the model to explore complex reasoning patterns on its own: advanced "thinking" functions such as **Self-verification**, **Reflection**, and **Chain-of-Thought** (CoT).

### 2. Performance Comparison: Comparable to OpenAI GPT-o1, with 95% Lower Cost
> **"DeepSeek-R1 has approached OpenAI's o1 in three major dimensions: mathematics, programming, and reasoning, while costing only about 5% as much!"**  
——Roth Capital Research Report

- Exam Performance: In the AIME 2024 mathematics competition, DeepSeek-R1 achieved a **pass@1 rate** of **71%**, which can be improved to **86.7%** through "majority voting";  
- User Reviews: On the App Store, DeepSeek-related applications have rapidly climbed the rankings, currently holding the top position, with many users praising its "transparent, lightweight, and user-friendly" characteristics.

### 3. Open Source, but Data Not Fully Open
- **MIT License**: Allows researchers and developers to freely reuse, modify, and extend the model;  
- Training data is not yet 100% publicly available, which limits the possibility of complete reproduction. However, DeepSeek has still provided valuable insights and technical references to the global AI community.

## AI Landscape Challenge: Running High-End AI on Lower-Spec Chips

DeepSeek's biggest technical "trump card" is proving that high-end AI no longer solely depends on expensive top-tier GPUs like **Nvidia A100, H100**. DeepSeek-V3's training primarily used **H800** chips, costing less than **$6 million**, significantly lower than many U.S. counterparts' investments that often run into hundreds of millions of dollars.

> **"This suggests that companies with high valuations based on expensive AI hardware might face uncertain prospects."**

## Broader Impact: U.S. Re-investment in AI

Shortly after DeepSeek-R1 was made public, **OpenAI CEO Sam Altman** met with **U.S. President Donald Trump** to jointly announce the **Stargate Project**, an AI infrastructure development plan with a **$500 billion** budget over four years, aiming to maintain global leadership in AI hardware.

However, DeepSeek's sudden emergence suggests that merely spending money on top-tier computing power may not be enough to create an absolute advantage.

## How does DeepSeek view its positioning?

1. **Reducing Expensive AI Costs**  
   - Core philosophy: Utilizing reinforcement learning + open source collaboration to enable numerous research institutions and enterprises to use and deploy high-performance AI with low barriers to entry.  
2. **Narrowing the AI Capability Gap Between China and the US**  
   - DeepSeek's emergence is seen as a symbol of Chinese AI teams competing with US counterparts like OpenAI and Meta in advanced models.  
3. **Diverse Business Models**  
   - From hedge fund financial backing to consumer products on the App Store, DeepSeek may expand rapidly along multiple paths in the future.

## Final Thoughts: Is DeepSeek Just the Beginning?

> From its founding in **2023** to its breakthrough in **2025**, DeepSeek accomplished unprecedented achievements and breakthroughs in just two years that most would find difficult to imagine.

- **For the AI Industry**: It represents a new paradigm of "achieving cutting-edge results with less hardware consumption," which may trigger a reallocation of resources;  
- **For Capital Markets**: The significant market value fluctuations reflect investors' reassessment of the future AI landscape;  
- **For Global AI Research**: Open-sourcing code while withholding complete data demonstrates DeepSeek's balance between advancing scientific innovation and protecting its competitive advantage.

Regardless, the emergence of DeepSeek-R1 has dropped a bombshell on the global AI community. Moving forward, with the advancement of U.S. projects like the Stargate Project, the race between AI computing power and algorithms will only intensify. Which direction will become mainstream in the next phase? We shall wait and see.
