# DeepSeek: A Quantitative Finance-Backed Startup "Shorting" U.S. Tech Stocks with Real Strength

Hello everyone, today I'd like to discuss **DeepSeek**, which has recently garnered global attention. This Chinese AI research lab, founded in **2023** by **Liam Wenfeng**, is strongly challenging the AI landscape dominated by U.S. tech giants with its open-source **DeepSeek-R1** model. Let's examine what highlights have propelled DeepSeek to the global spotlight so quickly and caused such significant fluctuations in the capital markets.

## As of press time: U.S. tech stocks plummet!

- **Bloomberg** reports that Nasdaq 100 futures and Europe's Stoxx 600 Technology sub-index both fell, wiping out a combined market value of **$1.2 trillion**;  
- The **"Magnificent Seven"** took a hit: 

  - Nvidia stock plunged **-11%**  
  - Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL) -3%  
  - Amazon (AMZN) -2.4%  
  - Meta (META) -1.4%  
  - Microsoft (MSFT) -3.2%  
  - Tesla (TSLA) -0.61%  
  - Apple (AAPL) bucked the trend, rising 1.2% due to the popularity of DeepSeek-related apps in the App Store  
  
- Chip stocks: ASML -6.2%, Broadcom (AVGO) -12%, Qualcomm (QCOM) -1.4%, AMD (AMD) -4.5%

Evidently, DeepSeek's "low hardware requirements" philosophy has put pressure on many chip and cloud computing service providers.

## DeepSeek Lab and Its Two Major Backgrounds

1. **Founder: Liam Wenfeng**  
   - Besides creating DeepSeek, he also founded the hedge fund **Phantom Quant** that supports DeepSeek. Clearly, this lab started with a dual "finance + technology" DNA.
2. **Initial Breakthrough: DeepSeek V3**  
   - In **December 2024**, DeepSeek first released its open-source LLM—DeepSeek V3, reportedly with a total investment of less than **$6 million**, using Nvidia's **H800** chips for training;  
   - It already gained some fame in the global AI community by touting "high performance, low cost".

## DeepSeek-R1: A New Benchmark for Low-Cost, High-Performance

DeepSeek's **R1** version, built upon **V3**, is seen as their ace to directly challenge OpenAI.

### 1. Reinforcement Learning Direct Drive: Breaking Conventional SFT
- DeepSeek-R1 relies almost entirely on **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to iterate the model, greatly reducing dependence on manually annotated data;  
- RL allows the model to explore complex reasoning patterns on its own: **Self-verification**, **Reflection**, and **Chain-of-Thought** (CoT) advanced "thinking" functions.

### 2. Performance Comparison: Comparable to OpenAI GPT-o1, at 95% Lower Cost
> **"DeepSeek-R1 approaches OpenAI's o1 in mathematics, programming, and reasoning, at only about 5% of the cost!"**  
—Roth Capital Research Report

- Exam questions: In the AIME 2024 math competition, DeepSeek-R1 achieved a **one-shot accuracy (pass@1)** of **71%**, which can be improved to **86.7%** through "majority voting";  
- User reviews: On the App Store, DeepSeek-related apps quickly climbed the rankings, currently topping the charts, with many users praising its "transparent, lightweight, and user-friendly" features.

### 3. Open Source, but Data Not Fully Open
- **MIT License**: Allows researchers and developers to freely reuse, modify, and extend the model;  
- Training data is not yet 100% public, limiting the possibility of complete reproduction. However, DeepSeek still provides valuable ideas and technical references to the global AI community.

## Challenge to the AI Landscape: High-End AI on Low-Spec Chips

DeepSeek's biggest technical "killer move" is proving that high-end AI no longer relies solely on expensive top-tier GPUs like **Nvidia A100, H100**. DeepSeek-V3's training mainly used **H800** chips, costing less than **$6 million**, significantly lower than the hundreds of millions of dollars invested by many U.S. counterparts.

> **"This means that companies with high valuations based on expensive AI hardware may see their prospects shaken."**

## Broader Impact: U.S. Reinvestment in AI

Shortly after DeepSeek-R1 went public, **OpenAI CEO Sam Altman** met with **U.S. President Donald Trump**, jointly announcing the **Stargate Project**, an AI infrastructure construction plan costing **$500 billion** over four years, aiming to maintain global leadership in AI hardware.

However, DeepSeek's emergence suggests that simply throwing money at top-tier computing power may not be enough to create an absolute advantage.

## How Does DeepSeek View Its Own Positioning?

1. **Alleviating Expensive AI Costs**  
   - Core philosophy: Using reinforcement learning + open-source collaboration to enable numerous research institutions and companies to use and deploy high-performance AI with low barriers.  
2. **Narrowing the AI Capability Gap Between China and the U.S.**  
   - DeepSeek's emergence is seen as a symbol of Chinese AI teams competing with U.S. counterparts like OpenAI and Meta in high-end models.  
3. **Diverse Business Models**  
   - From hedge fund support to consumer products on the App Store, DeepSeek may rapidly expand along multiple paths in the future.

## In Conclusion: Is DeepSeek Just the Beginning?

> DeepSeek went from its **2023** founding to making waves in **2025**, achieving unimaginable accumulation and breakthroughs in just two years.

- **对AI行业**：它代表着“更少硬件消耗也能取得尖端成果”的新范式，或将引发资源重新分配；  
- **对资本市场**：市值大幅震荡反映了投资者对未来AI版图的重新评估；  
- **对全球AI研究**：开放源码但未公布全部数据，显示出DeepSeek在推进科研创新和保护自身竞争力之间的权衡。

不管怎样，DeepSeek-R1的横空出世为全球AI圈投下一颗重磅炸弹。接下来，随着Stargate Project等美国项目的推进，AI算力与算法之间的竞赛只会愈演愈烈。究竟哪个方向会成为下一阶段的主流？我们拭目以待。
