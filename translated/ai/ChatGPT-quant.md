import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Fetch data
aapl = yf.Ticker("AAPL")
data = aapl.history(period="1y")

# Calculate indicators
data['SMA20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['SMA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['RSI'] = 100 - (100 / (1 + data['Close'].diff(1).clip(lower=0).rolling(14).mean() / 
                              data['Close'].diff(1).clip(upper=0).abs().rolling(14).mean()))

# Generate signals
data['Signal'] = 0
data.loc[(data['Close'] < data['SMA20']) & (data['RSI'] < 30), 'Signal'] = 1  # Buy signal
data.loc[(data['Close'] > data['SMA20']) & (data['RSI'] > 70), 'Signal'] = -1  # Sell signal

# Calculate returns
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].shift(1)
data['Returns'] = data['Close'].pct_change()
data['Strategy_Returns'] = data['Position'] * data['Returns']

# Calculate cumulative returns
data['Cumulative_Returns'] = (1 + data['Strategy_Returns']).cumprod()

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(data.index, data['Cumulative_Returns'])
plt.title('Mean Reversion Strategy Cumulative Returns')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Returns')
plt.show()

annual_return = data['Strategy_Returns'].mean() * 252
annual_volatility = data['Strategy_Returns'].std() * (252 ** 0.5)
sharpe_ratio = (annual_return - 0.02) / annual_volatility  # Assuming 2% risk-free rate

print(f"Total Return: {total_return:.2%}")
print(f"Annual Return: {annual_return:.2%}")
print(f"Annual Volatility: {annual_volatility:.2%}")
print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {sharpe_ratio:.2f}")
