# 获取 AAPL 的历史数据
data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2023-01-01')

# 计算 20 天和 50 天的简单移动平均线
data['SMA20'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
data['SMA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()

# 计算 RSI 指标
data['RSI'] = talib.RSI(data['Close'], timeperiod=14)

# 定义买入和卖出条件
data['Signal'] = 0
data.loc[(data['Close'] < data['SMA20']) & (data['RSI'] < 30), 'Signal'] = 1  # 买入信号
data.loc[(data['Close'] > data['SMA20']) & (data['RSI'] > 70), 'Signal'] = -1  # 卖出信号

# 计算持仓
data['Position'] = data['Signal'].replace(to_replace=0, method='ffill')

# 计算策略收益
data['Strategy_Return'] = data['Position'].shift(1) * data['Close'].pct_change()

# 计算累计收益
data['Cumulative_Strategy_Return'] = (1 + data['Strategy_Return']).cumprod()

# 绘制累计收益曲线
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(data['Cumulative_Strategy_Return'], label='策略累计收益')
plt.title('均值回归策略在 AAPL 上的表现')
plt.xlabel('日期')
plt.ylabel('累计收益')
