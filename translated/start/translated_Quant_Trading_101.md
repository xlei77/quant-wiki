## Basic Concepts and Terminology in Quantitative Trading, Covering Exchanges, Orders, and Market Makers

If you're planning to enter the field of **quantitative trading**, you need to quickly master a series of common terms. These terms are not only essential tools for work but also key to understanding the fundamental concepts of quantitative trading. Specifically, you need to understand what exchanges are, how they operate, and how trades are executed. Fortunately, this article will summarize these core concepts for you.

## What is an Exchange?

An exchange is at the core of quantitative trading. Simply put, an exchange is a **marketplace where buyers and sellers conduct transactions (i.e., trading) of financial products**. The purpose of an exchange is to ensure fair and just trading processes. Different exchanges support different financial assets, including securities, commodities, stocks, bonds, ETFs, event contracts, derivatives, cryptocurrencies, and more.

Some well-known exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), London Stock Exchange (LSE), and Kalshi. Of course, the notorious FTX also falls into this category. It's worth noting that exchanges don't necessarily require physical locations, as many exchanges are entirely digital.

## What is an Order?
An order is a core event that occurs within an exchange. An order is legally binding information that **informs exchange participants that someone is willing to buy or sell a financial product at a specific price**. Exchange participants, such as quantitative traders, can see the order's issuer, detailed information about the financial product, quantity, and price.

Orders are typically given specific names based on their trading direction. A "buy order" refers to the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay for a certain quantity of a financial product. Conversely, a "sell order" refers to the minimum price at which a seller is willing to sell a certain quantity of a financial product. For example, a $150 buy order for Meta stock means that the buyer must be willing to pay at least $150 to purchase that stock.

## What is Order Matching?

Order matching is the process of **pairing buy orders with sell orders at appropriate prices**. Simply put, when someone places a buy order, the exchange searches the market for sell orders with prices lower than or equal to the buy order. If a sell order's price is lower than or equal to the buy order's price, the trade will execute immediately. The trade occurs at the sell price, and the trading volume is the smaller of the buy and sell quantities. If the sell quantity is less than the buy quantity, only a portion of the buy order will be executed, with the remaining portion returning to the market. By default, buy orders remain in the exchange until they are executed.

Orders are typically stored in what is called an "order book." The order book records the price levels and quantities on both the buy and sell sides for all financial products.

## What is Market Making?
Market making is a **strategy commonly used by quantitative traders** where they simultaneously buy and sell financial products when uncertain about price direction, profiting from the bid-ask spread. Fundamentally, market makers are able to profit because they are willing to take on the risk of holding inventory of financial products, whose value may rise or fall.
