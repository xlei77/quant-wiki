## Summary

Quantitative hedge funds are investment companies that use advanced mathematical and statistical models along with computer algorithms to make investment decisions. In this article, we explore quantitative investing and provide insights into the most common quantitative strategies. For each quantitative strategy, we provide a description, discuss common signal types, examine historical performance across different markets, and analyze their historical risk and return characteristics.

> **While automation is discussed, in reality, it is humans who conduct research, decide on strategies, select the range of securities to trade, determine which data to use, and decide what hardware and connections are needed.**

## What is a Quantitative Hedge Fund?

The term "quantitative investment" is not a description of a **unified strategy**, but rather describes **how specific strategies are developed and implemented**. The distinction between quantitative strategies and discretionary strategies lies in how the strategies are created and implemented.

Quantitative strategies use **computer algorithms** for automated, systematic buy and sell decisions in trading. However, ultimately it is still **humans**, not machines, who are responsible for quantitative trading. It is humans who conduct research, decide on strategies, select the range of securities to trade, determine which data to use, and decide what hardware and connections are needed. The individuals and companies involved are typically referred to as "quants."

Quantitative trading strategies are typically differentiated by:

- **Asset Class**
- **Signal Classification**

These two conditions are often the main determinants of "sub-strategy classification." For example:

1. If a fund primarily trades individual stocks using short-term, technically-based signals with relatively short holding periods, it might be classified as an **equity statistical arbitrage** fund.
2. In contrast, if a fund only trades "macro instruments" such as futures, forex, and bonds, where price predictions are a function of both short-term technical indicators and long-term fundamental indicators, it might be classified as **quantitative macro**.

## Most Common Quantitative Strategies

- **Statistical Arbitrage in Equities**
- **Quantitative Market Neutral Equity Strategies**
- **Managed Futures/CTA**
- **Quantitative Macro**
- **Alternative Risk Premia**

The above list is far from exhaustive. Other strategy classifications may include:

- **Multi-Strategy Quantitative**: Funds that trade multiple asset classes and/or combine short-term statistical arbitrage in equities with longer-term models are currently often classified as "Statistical Arbitrage."
- **Quantitative Volatility**: If a fund's investment premise is to capture changes in volatility, it may be called volatility trading, even if this is executed using a quantitative process. Currently typically classified as "Volatility Arbitrage." If a fund combines volatility trading with other quantitative strategies, we typically classify it as "Statistical Arbitrage."

### Stock Statistical Arbitrage

#### Description

Statistical arbitrage funds typically utilize **price data** and their derivatives (such as correlations, volatility, and other forms of market data like trading volume and order book information) to identify the existence of patterns. Through the study of historical data, they identify repeatable patterns and data correlations that help managers predict future stock returns, usually within relatively short time periods. Relationships are identified through rigorous statistical analysis and backtesting. The strategy typically targets risk-adjusted returns higher than more "traditional" hedge funds, but actual return levels heavily depend on the leverage used and volatility tolerance.

#### Signal Types

- **Mean Reversion**: Aims to capitalize on short-term price fluctuations caused by supply-demand imbalances, where prices will revert to their "equilibrium level".
- **Momentum**: Seeks patterns in price data that indicate price movements will continue (i.e., trends).
- **Event-Driven**: Includes analyst earnings expectations, news flow sentiment, mergers and acquisitions, stock buybacks, index rebalancing, and corporate insider trading.

Some statistical arbitrage funds may also incorporate longer-term models driven by fundamental data. If these more fundamentally-oriented models are the primary drivers of risk, then the fund is closer to a **Quantitative Equity Market Neutral Strategy** (QEMN).

#### Performance in Different Markets

- Statistical arbitrage portfolios can generally generate returns across broad market directions.
- When correlations between stocks surge and market volatility spikes, statistical arbitrage may experience sharp drawdowns. However, after extreme volatility, the **opportunity set often becomes more fertile**.
- Low volatility + low trading volume environments are typically unfavorable for statistical arbitrage. It tends to be more successful when there are reasonable levels of price volatility and dispersion.
- Episodic risk factors or unforeseen risks can pose challenges to the model.

#### Example Trade

Suppose a fund identifies a historically strong correlation between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. If PepsiCo's stock price temporarily drops due to **liquidity supply-demand imbalance**, the fund simultaneously buys undervalued PepsiCo shares and shorts overvalued Coca-Cola shares, expecting the price ratio to revert to its historical mean.

#### Risk/Return Characteristics

- **Market Neutral**: Almost always operates at a very low beta coefficient.  
- Exposure to other common factors is typically offset through hedging.  
- May employ high leverage, but risk is managed through stop-losses, position size limits, factor exposure limits, etc.

### Quantitative Equity Market Neutral Strategy ("QEMN")

#### Description

The QEMN strategy utilizes fundamental and event-driven data (such as analyst earnings forecasts and financial data) and processes them systematically to score/rank stocks. Through optimization processes or simple rules, it constructs a market-neutral long-short portfolio while minimizing industry exposure.

#### Signal Types

- **Fundamental Data**: Earnings, revenue, profit margins, cash flow, etc.  
- **Technical Data**: MA, RSI, trading volume, price momentum, etc.  
- **Sentiment Data**: News articles, social media posts, analyst reports, etc.  
- **Alternative Data**: Such as satellite imagery, credit card data, weather patterns, etc.

Through machine learning algorithms, these signals are filtered and combined to construct market-neutral portfolios with long and short positions.

#### Performance in Different Markets

Similar to statistical arbitrage, QEMN may face challenges in environments with extreme market volatility and surging correlations.  
QEMN tends to perform better when stock prices are more fundamentally driven, with reasonable price differentials and oscillations.

#### Example Trading Strategy

1. **Data Collection and Processing**: Collect financial statements, earnings reports, and "alternative" data such as news articles and social media sentiment.  
2. **Signal Generation**: Calculate value (such as P/E ratio), growth (such as earnings growth rate), momentum (price trends), and quality (ROE, debt levels, etc.) signals.  
3. **Portfolio Construction and Risk Management**: Select approximately 100 long and 100 short positions in stocks, ensure industry and market cap neutrality, manage risk through stop-losses and position size limits.

#### Risk/Return Characteristics

- Low beta, market neutral.
- Some QEMN strategies may have exposure to specific style factors (e.g., value, momentum) and may incorporate factor timing signals.
- Leverage levels typically range from 3-8x, maintaining neutrality through hedging.

### Managed Futures/CTA

#### Description

Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) typically take directional positions in **index-level** or "macro instruments" (such as futures and forex) in a systematic manner. Among these, the most common strategy is **trend following**, which relies on technical price signals to buy rising markets, sell falling markets, and reposition when market trends reverse.  
The core of the CTA industry lies in **systematization**: from signal generation to execution, it heavily relies on computer models. With the popularization of trend following concepts, some more "generic" CTA strategies now have lower fees.

#### Signal Types

- Most CTAs focus on **price + volume** data as their core for trend identification.
- Can also include concepts such as **yield curves, seasonality, mean reversion, or pattern recognition**; some CTAs even incorporate **fundamental or alternative data**.
- May include short-term high-frequency pattern research.

#### Performance in Different Markets

- Historically shows **low correlation** with stocks and bonds, often performing excellently during high volatility or crisis periods, but tends to suffer in choppy, low volatility, or range-bound markets.
- Often generates significant profits in long-term trending markets, but may experience prolonged drawdowns during sudden reversals or abrupt changes in macro conditions.

#### Example Trades

- **Directional Positions**: Such as long or short positions in stock index futures.
- **Relative Value**: For example, trading the spread between Brent and WTI crude oil contracts, or conducting "curve trades" between contracts with different maturities on the futures curve.

#### Risk/Return Characteristics

- Diversification: Spans across stock indices, government bonds, commodity futures, and currency futures.
- Low Correlation: Typically low correlation with stocks and bonds.
- High Volatility and Drawdown: Expected Sharpe ratio around 0.5-1.0, not suitable for investors purely seeking high Sharpe ratios.
- Cash Efficiency: Margin requirements only 10-25% of total equity.
- Mechanical Risk Control: Dynamically adjusts portfolio size to adapt to market changes.

### Quantitative Macro and Global Asset Allocation ("GAA")

#### Description

Quantitative Macro analyzes vast economic, market, and other fundamental indicators, making trading decisions based on statistical models.  
This strategy partially overlaps with CTA as it also trades futures and other macro instruments, but Quantitative Macro tends to use **long-term fundamentals** (such as GDP, inflation, exchange rates, etc.) to drive trading decisions.

Quantitative Macro/GAA funds typically:

- Focus on **relative value** trades, while also taking directional positions.  
- Use a wide range of signals based on **economic data, country differentials, alternative data, technical indicators**, etc.  
- Average holding periods can range from several weeks to months, though can be shorter.

#### Signal Types

- **Macroeconomic Factors**: GDP, inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, imports and exports, etc.
- **Value, Yield, Momentum (Trend)** and other classic signals.
- **More Complex Elements**: such as weather, transportation data, geopolitical information, policy changes.

#### Performance in Different Markets

- Performs well during economic uncertainty, such as recessions or geopolitical crises.
- May underperform when markets are stable with slow changes, or when fundamentals become disconnected from market prices.
- Highly dependent on data quality and the model's ability to adapt to market changes.

#### Example Trades

- **Relative Value Models for Macro Instruments**: Trading based on interest rate differentials between countries and the impact of inflation forecasts on their exchange rates.
- **Cross-Asset Class**: Taking long/short positions by utilizing dynamic relationships between commodities/forex/bonds and other assets.

#### Risk/Return Characteristics

- Similar to CTA strategies, exhibits low correlation and high liquidity.
- Shows some vulnerability to undefined risk factors, requiring careful risk identification and model adjustments.
- Should not display persistent long or short bias.
- Higher volatility compared to most hedge funds, but provides diversification benefits in a portfolio.

### Alternative Risk Premia

#### Description

Alternative Risk Premia (ARP) strategies attempt to **systematically** capture returns from specific **risk factors**. Examples include value, momentum, low volatility, high yield, convergence spread, or merger risk premia.  
Through a **dynamic and replicable process**, these factor premiums are captured, typically with lower fees.  
The theory is that diversification through multi-factor/multi-market exposure helps improve the risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.

#### Signal Types

- Common factors: **value, momentum, yield spread, volatility, quality, liquidity**, etc.
- Each factor corresponds to specific buy/sell rules (such as buying undervalued and selling overvalued assets; buying positive momentum and selling negative momentum).
- Also includes risk arbitrage, such as merger arbitrage investment or convertible bond arbitrage.

#### Performance in Different Markets

- May show divergent performance during market volatility; its **low correlation** with traditional assets is an attractive feature.
- When correlations between assets converge and extreme risk events occur, ARP can also experience drawdowns.
- Different ARP funds vary significantly, depending on their factor combinations and hedging methods.

#### Example Trades

- **Spread Trading**: Simultaneously buying undervalued/selling overvalued positions between gold and silver to capture spread convergence.
- **Carry Trading**: Utilizing interest rate or yield differentials by allocating positions to high-yield assets while hedging low-yield assets.

#### Risk/Return Characteristics

- Designed to be **market neutral or low beta**, but **exposed to specific factors**, may experience significant drawdowns in extreme situations.  
- Generally highly liquid, traded through futures, swaps, ETFs, etc.  
- Fees significantly lower than traditional hedge funds; may use moderate leverage (1.5-2.0x) to enhance returns.
