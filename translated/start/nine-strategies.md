In the investment world, the **"perfect investment portfolio"** is almost a legend, with many beginners and veterans alike searching for that magical combination that can "maximize returns while minimizing risk." Unfortunately, such a perfect portfolio is like a unicorn, Santa Claus, or a mermaid—it simply doesn't exist.

After continuously observing, reading, and discussing various investment strategies, and reviewing countless investment experts, financial books, and industry discussions, you might discover that there are diverse opinions on how to construct your investment portfolio. Some advocate for "single fund dominance," others prefer "two-in-one" or "three-in-one" minimalist approaches, while supporters of "four-fund," "five-fund," or even portfolios with more than ten funds promoting "ultimate combinations" are not uncommon. This article uses nine of the most frequently mentioned investment portfolio strategies as examples to help you more intuitively understand the advantages and disadvantages of different strategies.

## 1. Strategy One: The Ultimate "One-Trick Pony"

The first portfolio strategy is so simple that it involves just one fund—either an S&P 500 index fund or a U.S. total market capitalization index fund (such as Vanguard's S&P 500 Index Fund VFIAX or Total Stock Market Index Fund VTSAX). This means that whether in retirement accounts or taxable accounts, all your money is invested in this single fund.

It might sound crazy, but quite a few investors have accumulated millions or even tens of millions of dollars in assets through this method. Its advantages lie in simplicity, low cost, and diversification (S&P 500 or total market funds inherently include hundreds or even thousands of companies). However, as you approach retirement, this 100% stock strategy might cause considerable stress during market downturns.

## 2. Strategy Two: Adding Bonds to Stocks

Building upon the "Single Fund" approach, you can choose two asset classes: stock index funds (such as VTSAX) and bond index funds (such as VBTLX). This method allows you to pursue stock market growth while using bonds to reduce overall volatility.

For example, the stock-to-bond ratio could be 90% stocks + 10% bonds, or a more conservative ratio. This is also one of the methods mentioned in Warren Buffett's trust fund investment plan for his wife's inheritance: 90% S&P 500 index + 10% short-term government bonds. It's simple, easy to implement, and can be readily adjusted based on age and risk tolerance.

## 3. Strategy Three: The Classic Combination of US Stocks, International Stocks, and Bonds

Building upon the two-fund approach by adding an international stock fund (such as Vanguard Total International Stock Market Index Fund VTIAX), this creates the "Three-Fund Strategy" highly advocated by the Bogleheads community. This strategy seeks broader global diversification through a combination of US stocks, international stocks, and bonds.

However, international allocation itself is controversial: some believe international market exposure is necessary, while others argue that US-listed companies already have global operations, making additional international market allocation unnecessary. Nevertheless, the "Three-Fund" strategy provides a relatively balanced global perspective.

## 4. Three Funds Plus One: Adding Real Estate Color

In addition to the three asset classes mentioned above, you can add REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts), such as the Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund (VGSLX), forming a "three plus one" strategy. REITs allow you to indirectly invest in real estate portfolios of office buildings, hotels, residential properties, and even shopping centers without becoming a landlord yourself.

If you want to add another layer of asset class diversity to the classic three-fund portfolio but don't want the hassle of buying and managing properties, REIT funds can be a good "addition."

## 5. Dave Ramsey's "Four Fund Strategy"

American renowned financial expert Dave Ramsey proposed a "four-fund" approach: 25% each in Growth & Income, Growth, Aggressive Growth, and International. Using Vanguard products as examples:

- 25% Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX) representing Growth & Income
- 25% Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund (VIMAX) representing Growth
- 25% Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund (VSMAX) representing Aggressive Growth
- 25% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund (VTIAX) representing International markets

Compared to the three-fund strategy, this approach breaks down the U.S. stock portion into more specific categories. However, its drawback is the absence of bonds as a stable element. Additionally, while Ramsey often discusses actively managed funds, I personally prefer passive index funds with lower expense ratios.

## 6. Bill Bernstein's "No-Brainer" Portfolio

Bill Bernstein, who holds a Ph.D. in Chemistry and worked as a neurologist, proposed a portfolio known as the "no-brainer," which equally distributes funds among:

- Bonds (VBTLX)
- European Stocks (VEUSX)
- U.S. Small-Cap Stocks (VSMAX)
- S&P 500 (VFIAX)

25% each, totaling four funds. This strategy aims to achieve robust long-term performance through geographical and market capitalization diversification.

## 7. Ivy League Endowment Fund Style Portfolio

The endowment fund management strategies of Ivy League schools like Harvard, Yale, and Stanford often attract significant attention. They invest in stocks, bonds, international stocks, real estate, commodities, and even private equity and venture capital.

A simplified "Ivy League style" portfolio can be structured as follows:

- 35% US Stocks (VTSAX)
- 28% Bonds (VBTLX)
- 15% International Stocks (VTIAX)
- 11% Commodities (e.g., VCMDX)
- 11% Real Estate (VGSLX)

The only hesitation for investors here might be the selection and cost of commodity funds, as well as their actively managed nature. However, if you want to try an Ivy League style diversified allocation, this is certainly one approach to consider.

## 8. "Coffeehouse Portfolio"

Investment writer Bill Schultheis proposed a seven-fund portfolio in his book "The Coffeehouse Investor," which includes S&P 500, value stocks, small-cap stocks, international small-cap stocks, REITs, international stocks, and a large portion of bonds. For example:

- 10% VFIAX (S&P 500)
- 10% VVIAX (Large-cap Value)
- 10% VSMAX (Small-cap)
- 10% International Small-cap (such as VFSVX or similar funds)
- 10% VGSLX (REIT)
- 10% VTIAX (International Stocks)
- 40% VBTLX (Bonds)

While it offers broader diversification, the portfolio is somewhat complex, and periodic rebalancing may require significant effort.

## 9. "Ultimate Buy and Hold" Portfolio

This is a strategy advocated by Paul Merriman that divides investments into 11 categories, including S&P 500, value stocks, small-cap stocks, small-cap value stocks, REITs, international stocks, international small-caps, international value stocks, emerging markets, and short-term bonds. Here's an example:

- 6% each in various U.S. and international funds, including emerging markets and international small-cap value stocks
- Approximately 40% in short-term bonds (such as Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund VBIRX)

This strategy aims to capture potential advantages across all dimensions of global markets through extreme diversification. However, relatively speaking, management and rebalancing can be very complex, making it costly for average investors.

## Conclusion: There's No Perfect Strategy, Only Suitable Ones

After reviewing these strategies, you'll notice their complexity ranges from "single fund" to "more than ten funds." Some advocate for minimalism, while others believe greater diversification brings stable returns. But regardless of which path you choose, understand this: there is no perfect portfolio. No one can predict with 100% certainty which combination will perform best in the future.

The key is to choose an approach that you understand and are willing to stick with long-term. Don't frequently change strategies or constantly rebalance due to short-term market fluctuations. Investing is a marathon, not a sprint - as long as your direction is right and your steps are steady, you can progress steadily even without a "perfect portfolio."

Hopefully, these examples provide some inspiration. If you're still finding your investment path, perhaps start simple and then gradually adjust based on your risk tolerance and convictions, making your investment portfolio truly "work for you."
