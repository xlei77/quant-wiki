## A series of established trading competitions. Win substantial prizes, network with companies and recruiters, and secure internship opportunities.

## What are Trading Competitions?

As is widely known, the most reliable path to enter the quantitative finance field is to secure an internship opportunity. Internships not only potentially lead to full-time offers but also demonstrate your professional capabilities to other companies.

Therefore, students spend several weeks each year polishing side projects, optimizing resumes, practicing mental math games, and taking online courses to thoroughly prepare for internship interviews. While these are all excellent preparation methods, students often overlook a simpler and more efficient option: **trading competitions**.

As the name suggests, trading competitions are competitive events organized by academic institutions or companies where students form teams to trade in a risk-free environment (using "virtual funds" during the competition). Most trading competitions start on Friday evening and continue throughout the weekend. These competitions are excellent opportunities to gain hands-on experience trading various financial instruments while offering substantial prize money to winners. Even more exciting is the chance to network with numerous participating companies and potentially secure internship opportunities.

In this article, we will comprehensively analyze how to stand out in trading competitions. From pre-competition preparation to in-competition strategies, we will reveal everything you need to know. Additionally, we will list the top trading competitions scheduled for the coming months to help you plan ahead.

## Trading Competition Preparation Guide

Before diving into trading competitions, it's essential to thoroughly understand the competition rules and guidelines. Each competition will detail this information on their official website, and it's crucial to study these carefully before participating. If you're not familiar with the asset classes involved in the competition (such as event contracts), it's recommended to gain hands-on experience beforehand.

After familiarizing yourself with the competition process, the next step is building your team. Consider asking classmates around you if they're interested in forming a team, or search for like-minded partners through school clubs.

Many students fall into a common trap when participating: excessive focus on winning. While winning is the goal, it's important to recognize the intense competition level. Therefore, even if you don't reach the top, you should extract valuable experience from the process.

Trading competitions typically include dedicated networking sessions for participants to interact with sponsoring companies. This is an excellent opportunity to make a strong first impression and pave the way for future interviews. Make sure you have prepared a polished resume and practiced a concise, powerful self-introduction for such occasions.
