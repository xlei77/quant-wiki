## Summary

Macro funds typically establish positions (either directional or relative value) in currencies, bonds, stocks, and commodities based on **fundamental and qualitative judgments**. Investment decisions usually rely on managers' top-down views of **economics and politics**, such as their perspectives on economic growth, interest rates, inflation, government policies, geopolitics, and more. Relative valuations within and between asset classes may also play a role in the investment process.

In this article, we explore macro trading and delve into the most common macro strategies. For each macro strategy, we provide strategy descriptions, example trades, and consider the historical performance of these strategies across different market environments.

## What are Macro Hedge Funds?

Macro hedge funds focus on trading asset classes primarily driven by **macroeconomic factors**, especially fixed income and to a lesser extent currencies and commodities. Since bottom-up factors play a larger role in equities and credit, macro hedge funds are less active in these two areas. However, they typically express top-down views on equities and credit through aggregated securities (such as index futures, credit default swaps, etc.).

Macro managers **take tactical risk positions** and prefer dynamic portfolio adjustments. They require high liquidity in their traded securities, which leads them to focus mainly on developed markets, unless they are funds specifically dedicated to emerging markets. Additionally, extensive use of derivatives (futures, options, swaps) is another key characteristic of macro funds, which not only provides leverage but also allows better expression of investment intentions during critical periods (high volatility phases).

Macro trading can be either directional or relative value. While quantitative analysis increasingly supports macro trading, ultimate risk decisions often remain **discretionary**. Generally, macro hedge funds trade with time horizons ranging from several days to several months.
> **As short-term trading becomes increasingly competitive with quantitative strategies, macro funds have reduced their proportion of short-term trading**.

## Most Common Macro Strategies

Macro funds can be classified in multiple ways. Here are the four common sub-strategies:

1. **Global Macro**
2. **Fixed Income Relative Value (FIRV)**
3. **Macro Emerging Markets**
4. **Commodities**

Among these, Global Macro is the largest sub-strategy, accounting for more than half of total macro fund assets. Fixed Income Relative Value accounts for approximately one-quarter, Macro Emerging Markets accounts for about one-fifth, while Commodities is the smallest macro sub-strategy.

## Risk-Return Summary

| Strategy | Typical Trading Assets | Directional or Relative Value Preference | Long/Short Bias | Beta to Traditional Risk Assets | Historical Volatility | Liquidity | Typical Leverage |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|------------|------------------|
| **Global Macro** | Fixed income, currencies, commodities; aggregate securities in stocks/credit; related derivatives | Combines directional and relative value, old-school tends toward directional, new-school prefers relative value | None | Low (over medium-term horizon) | Below average, medium-low among hedge fund strategies | High | Medium to high, depends on portfolio |
| **Fixed Income Relative Value** | Government bonds and derivatives such as futures, options, and swaps | Relative value | None | Low | Below average (among the lowest), but with tail risk | High | Very high |
| **Macro Emerging Markets** | Emerging markets fixed income, currencies, equities, commodities; and related derivatives | Mostly directional | Usually long-biased (especially in fixed income) | Medium to high | Above average (more volatile among macro strategies) | Lower than developed markets, higher risk | Low to medium |

## Global Macro

### Description

Global macro funds have the broadest investment mandate, allowing trading **across asset classes, financial products, and geographies**. The strategy is typically driven by a **top-down** or "macro" perspective, focusing on factors such as:

- Economic growth
- Interest rates
- Inflation
- Capital flows
- Policy and geopolitics

Since interest rates and currencies are more sensitive to these factors, funds often focus on **fixed income** and some currency exposure; for equities and credit, they tend to express views through aggregated securities (ETFs, futures, credit derivatives).

Global macro managers typically feature:

- **Tactical risk-taking**: Flexible portfolio adjustment;
- **Strong liquidity preference**: Preference for developed markets;
- **Extensive use of derivatives**: Futures, options, swaps, etc.

#### "Old School" vs "New Macro"

- **Traditional Macro (Macro 1.0)**: Larger single "discretionary" positions, held for weeks to months, can generate "chunky" returns.
- **New Macro (Macro 2.0)**: More focused on relative value, uses more complex derivatives, diversified smaller positions, more stable returns but potentially limited upside.

### Example Trades

- **Directional**: Such as "risk-off" trades during the early pandemic, going long government bonds, USD, precious metals, volatility, while simultaneously shorting stocks, crude oil, etc.
- **Relative Value**: Such as yield curve flattening trades, buying/selling contracts of different maturities on the same government bond curve.

### Performance

- Opportunities typically increase during periods of **market disruption or policy shifts** (such as financial crises, pandemic shocks, high inflation).  
- Returns may be insufficient during **calm, low-volatility** periods.  
- Has **contrarian and value** characteristics, requires high liquidity; exhibits positive tail features, often with low correlation to traditional assets.

### Risk/Return Characteristics

- Different funds vary significantly, but overall they exhibit **high alpha ratios** with relatively low market beta.
- Display characteristics of **long volatility** or **tail risk hedging**, can provide diversification in portfolios.

## Fixed Income Relative Value ("FIRV")

### Description

FIRV funds exploit **internal pricing discrepancies in fixed income markets** by simultaneously taking long and short positions in highly correlated bonds to achieve market-neutral or near market-neutral exposure. They primarily use **government bonds and their derivatives**.

- **Sources of pricing discrepancies**: Market events, supply-demand imbalances, capital flows, regulatory changes, etc.
- **High leverage**: Due to thin profit margins, leverage is needed to amplify returns.

FIRV trading was historically dominated by investment bank proprietary trading desks. In recent years, **hedge funds (especially multi-strategy platforms)** have become the primary vehicles. Barriers to entry include requirements for specialized talent, funding channels, large-scale technology, and risk management systems.

### Example Trades

- **Basis Trading**: Going long cash treasury bonds while shorting futures contracts (or vice versa) to capture basis convergence.
- **Yield Curve Steepener/Flattener**: Taking long or short positions in bonds (interest rate swaps) of different maturities.

### Performance

- More opportunities arise during periods of **moderate interest rate increases/volatility spikes**.
- Market shocks such as the 2008 financial crisis and 2020 pandemic outbreak may lead to large drawdowns, with potential forced exits due to financing pressure.
- Features high leverage, with historical cases of extreme tail risk including the collapse of LTCM (1998).

### Risk/Return Characteristics

- **Stable but moderate** returns, with low volatility and typically higher Sharpe ratios.  
- Often described as "picking up pennies in front of a steamroller" - potential for severe losses if faced with liquidity or funding chain break risks.
- Low correlation with traditional assets and other hedge fund strategies, offering good diversification capabilities.

## Macro Emerging Markets

### Description

Focuses on emerging economies (relative to developed markets), thus sharing similar top-down logic with global macro funds, but with **poorer liquidity and less developed derivatives markets**.

- Tends toward **directional** positions and **long bias**; emerging market currencies and stocks can be shorted, but fixed income shorting is more difficult.
- Emerging markets have shorter cycles and are more susceptible to external shocks; managers typically need more extensive experience to adapt to volatile environments.
- Wide investment scope: sovereign bonds, quasi-sovereign bonds, currencies, stocks, commodities, etc., ranked by trading activity. Credit opportunities are limited.

### Example Trades

- Long position in a country's bonds or currency, based on government reforms, IMF loans, or macroeconomic expectations;  
- Short position in another country's exchange rate or government bonds where political or fiscal conditions are deteriorating.

### Performance

- During periods of **rising risk appetite**, generally favorable for emerging markets; conversely, they suffer significant drawdowns.  
- More dependent on the stability of global risk sentiment, global events (such as recessions, geopolitical conflicts) tend to impact emerging markets more severely.

### Risk/Return Characteristics

- **High risk, high return**, with the highest volatility among macro strategies;  
- Typically has **medium to high** emerging market beta, vulnerable during crisis periods;  
- Difficult to fully hedge downside risk, Sharpe ratio may be lower than global macro.

## Commodities

### Description

Commodity funds **specialize** in trading **futures and options** of commodities such as energy, metals, agricultural products, as well as some related stocks.

- Heavily discretionary in nature, extensively utilizing fundamental analysis and data science.
- Commonly distinguished between **directional** and **relative value** styles:
  - **Directional**: Taking long/short positions based on supply-demand imbalances and macro factors;
  - **Relative Value**: Such as **curve trading** (futures with different maturities), **cross-commodity trading** (spreads between related commodities, crack spreads, spark spreads, etc.).
- Some funds prefer "long-only or cash" positions, while others maintain complete market neutrality.

### Example Trades

- **Trend Trading**: Such as weather anomalies in a country causing supply-demand imbalances in agricultural products;  
- **Crack Spread Trading**: Simultaneously trading the price differential between crude oil and downstream products (gasoline/heating oil);  
- **Inter-commodity Arbitrage**: Silver-to-gold ratio, platinum-to-palladium ratio, etc.

### Performance

- Commodities exhibit high volatility and are easily affected by geopolitical events and climate changes, with clear trend opportunities:
  - Showed outstanding performance during 2003-2007, 2009-2010, and during the inflationary shock after the 2020 pandemic;
  - Insufficient returns during periods of low volatility and sideways markets.

### Risk/Return Characteristics

- High volatility with unstable returns; some funds have high Sharpe ratios but generally below 1.
- **Low correlation** with other assets and hedge fund strategies;
- Can achieve high returns but bears significant tail risk, especially in directional highly leveraged or crowded trades.
