After graduating from university, I joined Point72 directly. At that time, they had just launched a development program recruiting new graduates from universities, training them, and ultimately placing them on trading desks within research teams. This was how I started my career.

When I began researching stocks and companies, I primarily focused on TMT (Technology, Media, and Telecommunications) sector companies, particularly those related to payments and tech hardware. Payment companies included Visa, Mastercard, Square (now known as Block), etc.; hardware companies included Cisco, Arista, Nokia, etc., which produce large metal equipment for global data centers. These were the two areas I studied in depth.

However, companies don't exist in isolation. To fully understand them, you must comprehend the ecosystem they operate in. Therefore, I also engaged with and learned about a broader range of companies, including telecommunications, media, and some internet companies, which was necessary for doing my job well.

Looking back at my career development, especially in multi-manager hedge funds, I believe that as an analyst, you must first master the basic skills of the job. This can feel overwhelming because the ultimate goal is to identify longs that will go up and shorts that will go down, understand risk metrics and various factors. But before you can understand these, you first need to master the core skills required to be a good financial analyst.

These core skills include how to build financial models, how to read 8-K filings, do you know when companies release 8-Ks? How do you get this information? Does the company provide annual guidance or quarterly guidance? Where does this guidance typically come from? Do companies typically provide conservative guidance or reflect their true expectations? How does the CEO view M&A and divestitures? How does the CFO behave? All of these are fundamental facts you need to thoroughly master for every company, every model, and every business.

After mastering these fundamentals, you can elevate your perspective and think about company strategy: Does what's happening in this space make sense? Are their decisions wise? Are economic changes favorable or unfavorable to them? Then, you can further consider: "Based on everything I understand, what do I think the rest of the world understands about this industry or this business? Do I have a differentiated view?" As you develop layer by layer of understanding about a business, you get closer to determining whether a stock will go up or down over a specific period.

If you can master all of this and are very lucky, hopefully, your judgment will be slightly better than 50% accurate.

## Generation of Investment Ideas

Regarding investment idea generation, it's actually quite straightforward. What you really care about isn't how to generate a single idea, but how to establish a sustainable pipeline that continuously generates ideas leveraging your competitive advantages. That's all there is to investment idea generation.

Many people over-complicate this process, thinking they need to satisfy numerous conditions and checkboxes to form an idea. This actually doesn't work, because if everyone does it this way, then the idea is no longer a good one - you're just following market consensus.

So what makes investment idea generation scalable? Every company in the world sits on a spectrum, from very poor businesses to excellent ones. Assuming you as an analyst or portfolio manager (PM) and your team possess strong business acumen and can accurately place each company on this spectrum, you can examine your entire coverage universe and know where these businesses stand. Some businesses are simply better quality than others, and we need to recognize this - that's fine, and they're priced differently.

Investment idea generation comes from understanding how these businesses move along that spectrum. A long position isn't simply a good business, at least not in the multi-manager fund world I've experienced. A long is a business that will move from one part of the spectrum to a slightly better part. Very rarely does a company go from being an extremely poor business to the best business - this almost never happens, and vice versa.

But that's not what you're looking for. You're not looking for 100-baggers; you're not looking for companies that go from investment-grade credit to distressed overnight - that's not realistic, and you can't build a scalable system around that.

What happens frequently is that based on a new piece of news, based on an acquisition in the market, based on an earnings cycle, the business fundamentally gets slightly better or slightly worse. Once you identify this delta, what you need to ask yourself is what's the market's reaction to this delta? Are people expecting the business to go from slightly worse to very bad? Is that a realistic expectation? Are people expecting the business to go from good to great? Is that realistic?

Therefore, some of the best shorts aren't companies that go from challenging businesses to bankruptcy (although that might be a good short, but it's expensive). Some of the best shorts are those absolute best businesses in people's minds that become "hey, this is just a very good business." That delta creates enormous shorting opportunities.

Similarly, some businesses that people think are "just okay businesses" transform from okay businesses to "hey, there's something really interesting here." That becomes a great long opportunity.

When you think about the world in terms of incremental changes in business quality and compare that to people's expectations of incremental differences, you can scale your entire portfolio for investment ideas because every business changes every quarter, and in fact multiple times per quarter. Once you have this framework, you know you can generate many ideas. Thus, your idea generation isn't constrained by the number of ideas per stock, but by the number of stocks. Once your bottleneck is the number of stocks, as an investment manager, this becomes an easier problem to solve because you just need to figure out how to cover more stocks. Are you providing tools for your team to cover more stocks, or are you adding more people to cover stocks? But that's a solvable problem.

## Understanding the Components of Profit

If you take a step back and think about what profit (P&L) is, in absolute terms, it can be broken down into three functions:

1. **Number of Ideas**: The number of investment ideas you generate, i.e., how many times you place bets.

2. **Hit Rate**: The percentage of times your bets are correct.

3. **Slugging**: How much do you gain when you're right? How much do you lose when you're wrong?

Therefore, profit can be expressed as: Velocity × Hit Rate × Slugging × Assets Under Management (AUM).

What you want to optimize are these three elements. Holding one idea for a long time without having many ideas will significantly reduce your trading velocity. When you're trying to run a market-neutral strategy and need to constantly balance your portfolio, low trading velocity isn't always a good thing. You might not want trading velocity to be too high because this generates excessive commissions, but you want to have a reasonable trading velocity.

## Understanding the Market Story

When discussing a company's investment story, there are three main sources:

1. **The Company Itself**: What story does the company want to convey? This is usually the easiest to obtain. You can understand this by listening to the company's earnings calls and analyst days, as they work to control the narrative.

2. **Sell-Side**: Sell-side analysts also tell a story, which may deviate from what the company says, depending on their perspective. In most cases, these stories are relatively similar.

3. **Buy-Side**: This might be the hardest story to figure out, yet it's the one you really need to understand. Different types of buy-side investors (such as long-term holders, market-neutral strategists, retail investors, etc.) each have their own investment logic and focus areas.

You need to understand how different investor groups think and their expectations for the company to form your own investment decisions.

## Market Neutral Strategies and Risk Management

Market neutral strategies aim to achieve a portfolio beta value (Beta) close to zero, meaning a low correlation with the market. This involves complex risk management, including hedging market risk, sector risk, and other factor risks.

Measuring Beta is challenging because time periods, market definitions, and factor exposures all affect the results. Advanced analysts need to understand these complexities, not only about company operations but also about stock trading characteristics and risk factors.

## Effective Stock Pitching

Pitching a stock is not the main part of the job. The best pitches come from your in-depth research and unique insights about a company, rather than just a summary of company fundamentals. You need long-term tracking and deep understanding of a company to propose truly valuable investment recommendations.

## Impact of Systematic Trading Strategies

Systematic Strategies can be classified into three categories:

1. **High Frequency Low Latency**: Strategies that rely on trading speed.

2. **Medium Latency/Medium Holding Period Strategies**: Holding periods ranging from weeks to months, trading based on quantitative signals.

3. **Rule-Based Investing**: Strategies similar to ETFs, following pre-established rules.

Understanding how these strategies affect the market helps you better predict stock price fluctuations and changes in trading volume.

## Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Investment

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming many aspects of the financial industry. However, as an analyst, you need to be cautious in selecting which components to automate. Core analytical and judgment capabilities should not be replaced, especially in interpreting management information and understanding business operations. Automation can help handle tedious tasks, but deep business understanding still requires human insight.

## Summary

Working in a hedge fund requires solid fundamentals, deep understanding of the business, and keen insight into market dynamics. Through continuous learning and practice, analysts can enhance their capabilities to generate alpha for the portfolio. Understanding company fundamentals, market expectations, and investor behavior is key to success.
