## Excellent Project Portfolio for Those Aspiring to Showcase Their Skills to Employers in Quantitative Finance

Given the **fierce competition** for jobs in quantitative finance, many students mistakenly believe that having an Ivy League degree, being a mathematics olympiad participant, or possessing certain exceptional technical abilities are the only ways to enter this industry. However, this notion is far from reality. In fact, quantitative employers often place more emphasis on an individual's curiosity, demonstrated passion, and work attitude. Personal projects are one of the best ways to highlight these qualities. Candidates who complete personal projects not only have a better chance of passing resume screenings but also tend to achieve better results during the interview process.

Whether you want to develop your career in quantitative trading, quantitative research, or quantitative development, engaging in personal projects can significantly increase your chances of entering these fields. In this article, we will introduce some practical **quantitative finance projects** that you can use to create a portfolio to showcase to future employers. Additionally, we will share modern technologies and tools you can use in these projects to help you stand out from the competition.

## Project #1 - Building a Trading Engine from Scratch
Quantitative developers are responsible for building and managing the company's trading systems. These systems take market data as input and generate trade orders as output. While developing a fully functional and stable trading system is quite challenging, implementing a simplified example is a feasible task. In this project, you will build a trading client that initiates trade requests and a server that receives and processes these requests.

## Project #2 - Machine Learning Visualization Project

Quantitative researchers often use machine learning to build trading algorithms. Although modern machine learning has become easy to use through APIs like sklearn and TensorFlow, understanding the internal mechanisms of these algorithms remains crucial. In this project, you can develop a tool to visualize a concept in machine learning. A good example is a K-Means clustering visualizer.

## Project #3 - Develop Data-Driven Investment Strategies

As a quantitative researcher, you will explore and develop strategies that companies can use for profitable trading. These strategies include both short-term trading and long-term investments. In this project, you can try using OpenBB's data to research and validate an investment strategy. OpenBB is an investment research platform that provides free data for cryptocurrencies, forex, futures, stocks, and more through its Python API.

## Project #4 - Option Pricing Models
**Option pricing models** are essential tools for quantitative traders and researchers, used to calculate the theoretical value of options. Understanding the theoretical value of options helps investors optimize their trading strategies and select option combinations with the highest profit potential. Since there is no single standard method for calculating the theoretical value of options, various techniques have evolved. In this project, you can implement one of these pricing models using any programming language. Here are three common pricing models:

### 1/ Monte Carlo

Monte Carlo pricing is based on the statistical principle of the Law of Large Numbers. This method generates a large number of random price paths for the underlying asset, with each path corresponding to a specific payoff. These payoffs are averaged and discounted to the present time to ultimately derive the option price.

### 2/ Binary Tree

The binary tree pricing model evaluates option values by simulating how financial instrument prices change over time.

### 3/ Black-Scholes

The Black-Scholes model is one of the most famous models in options pricing. It calculates option values using parameters such as strike price, current stock price, time to expiration, risk-free rate, and volatility.

## Project #5 - Develop and Backtest Trading Strategies
If you're looking for a job as a quantitative trader, working on this type of project could be ideal. A quantitative trader's task is to execute profitable trades for their company, so demonstrating that you have **implemented and successfully applied trading strategies** will impress potential employers. Additionally, backtesting your strategies demonstrates your ability to systematically evaluate your methods and assumptions. This project can be developed in any programming language you prefer, though Python is typically the first choice due to its numerous libraries that simplify the process. Here are some trading strategies you might consider:

### 1/ Dual-Share Class Arbitrage

This strategy exploits price differences between shares listed on different markets. (For example: GOOG vs GOOGL)

### 2/ Bollinger Bands Strategy

Bollinger Bands are calculated by computing the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of stock prices, then setting the upper and lower bands at two standard deviations above and below the SMA.

### 3/ Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Reinforcement learning is a rapidly developing field in machine learning that has been applied to various algorithmic trading scenarios. Developing your own algorithms to trade specific financial products can become a standout project in your portfolio.

### 4/ Industry-Based Pairs Trading Algorithm

This trading algorithm is based on the concept that two assets within the same industry or sector are likely to exhibit similar performance. Therefore, significant price deviations between them can be profited from by buying the underperforming asset or shorting the outperforming asset.
