## Summary

Multi-strategy hedge funds maximize risk-adjusted returns by investing across various underlying investment strategies or different sub-strategies within the same main strategy. They typically maintain flexibility in capital allocation, aiming to dynamically allocate to the best opportunities, shift resources where they're most needed, and even completely avoid certain strategies or assets. They are often favored by investors seeking stable returns across different market cycles.

Scalability is another reason for the popularity of multi-strategy funds, especially among large allocators; more capital can be quickly allocated to successful portfolio managers, who can hire additional managers to run similar portfolios. This scalability may lead to the emergence of behemoths, which some view as a hindrance while others see it as an advantage. There is a significant size bias within the multi-strategy space, which is somewhat dominated by a small number of very large, established firms.

In alpha/beta profit and loss attribution analysis, multi-strategy funds stand out for having the highest proportion of returns attributable to alpha. Due to their diversified nature of investments, they also demonstrate one of the lowest volatilities among main strategy groups. Multi-strategy funds tend to have among the highest Sharpe ratios in the hedge fund industry while maintaining one of the lowest volatilities. However, multi-strategy hedge funds are not a homogeneous group and can vary enormously; they may adopt different business models, focus areas, risk parameters, concentration levels, liquidity requirements, and fee structures.

The scale and complexity of multi-strategy hedge funds mean that investment and operational due diligence requires substantial experience and resources, making it not for the faint of heart.

## Classification of Multi-Strategy Domain — Three Types

Aurum tends to view multi-strategy funds according to three main business types, each with distinct characteristics. The characteristics of these funds are fluid, and funds can evolve from one category to another over time.

1. **Opportunistic/Dynamic ("Multi-Opportunistic")**  
2. **Multi-Manager — Focused ("Multi-Focused")**  
3. **Multi-Manager — Diversified ("Diversified")**

---

### Opportunistic/Dynamic ("Multi-Opportunistic")

- These funds have only one or very few fund managers who dynamically allocate capital across different strategies based on where the best opportunities lie.
- They may have a single fund manager who participates in different strategies opportunistically, or a Chief Investment Officer (CIO) who allocates capital to sub-managers or specialists who run different strategies.
- The defining characteristic is that capital is dynamically shifted to areas with the best opportunities, while reducing or completely avoiding deployment in less favorable strategies.
- Typically uses traditional management and performance fees, meaning fund managers are compensated based on overall business success.
- This model is suitable for cyclical strategies that perform well in different environments. It also suits managers who prefer collaboration and being compensated based on overall company success rather than individual performance.
- Capital doesn't need to be forcibly deployed during periods of poor opportunity sets, however, compensation may be undervalued when an individual manager performs well but the company as a whole underperforms.

---

### Multiple Fund Managers - Focused Type ("Multi-Focused")

- These funds have multiple fund managers running **independent portfolios**, but typically deploy similar strategies or focus on narrower areas.  
- A stock platform fund is an example of this, where many industry or regional specialists run individual market-neutral stock portfolios.  
- Another example is a fund that invests in many different strategies but only in one region, such as an Asia-focused multi-strategy fund.  
- These types of funds can be classified as "multi-focused" because their strategic scope is smaller than "diversified" but larger than "multi-opportunistic."

---

### Multiple Fund Managers — Diversification ("Multi-Manager")

- Typically very large funds that may organize strategy groups as **independent business units**.
- These business units each have their own management structure and underlying fund managers; their combination forms a multi-strategy hedge fund.
- For example, the fund may have separate **long/short equity, credit, fixed income/macro, and arbitrage** business units.
- Capital allocation between business units tends to be relatively stable. At individual fund manager level, allocation may be jointly determined by risk teams and capacity factors.
- These funds often employ a **pass-through fee structure** ("pass-through" model), ensuring teams are compensated based on their own performance rather than overall firm performance.
- The model is highly scalable, allowing for both addition of more managers to the same strategy and expansion into new strategies and regions.

## Characteristic Table

| Variable | Multi-Opportunistic | Multi-Focused | Diversified |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Fund Managers** | 1~few managers | Multiple fund managers | Multiple fund managers |
| **Collaboration** | Highly collaborative | Relatively independent teams | Independent business units, occasional high-level collaboration |
| **Fees** | Traditional management + performance fees | Mostly pass-through fees | Pass-through fees |
| **Capital Allocation** | Dynamic | Less frequent adjustments | Less frequent adjustments |
| **Ability to Adjust Position Size or Tilt Portfolio** | Flexibly managed by CIO | Managed through central book | Managed through central book |
| **Leverage** | Low | Higher | Highest |
| **Liquidity** | Strategy dependent | Strategy dependent | Strategy dependent |
| **Management Structure** | CIO model | CIO + Risk Management | Business heads, committees, multi-level management |
| **Fund Manager Compensation** | Based on overall business success | Based on individual performance | Based on individual performance |
| **Size** | Wide range, small to large | Medium to large, <$1B | Large to very large, >$5B |
| **Employee Count** | Generally <100 | 100~1000 | >1000 people |
| **Risk Management** | CIO or single CRO | CRO + team | Large multi-level risk team |
| **Offices** | Single/few offices | Central + regional offices | Multiple global centers |

## Deployed Strategies

Multi-strategy hedge funds generally invest in various hedge fund strategies, most notably including:

- **Macro and Fixed Income**
- **Long/Short Equity and Fundamental Equity Market Neutral**
- **Credit**
- **Event Driven**
- **Quantitative**
- **Commodities**
- **Arbitrage**
- **Others** (such as reinsurance, trade finance, cryptocurrency trading, etc.)

## Portfolio Construction

### Capital Allocation

Depends on how much capital the fund has and the manageable size for each fund manager. Capital increases when managers expand their teams and build more capacity. Poor performance or low utilization leads to reduced allocation.  
In **opportunistic funds**, allocation is more flexible and adjusted dynamically based on opportunities; in **diversified funds**, allocation is relatively stable, determined through risk team assessment and capacity evaluation.

### Central Book

Multi-strategy hedge funds can operate a **central book** to manage risk or positions across various manager strategies.

- **Replication Book**: Simply replicates each manager's portfolio and operates with higher leverage.
- **Alpha Capture**: Systematically generates additional alpha based on historical and real-time trading data from managers.
- **Hedging**: Hedges unwanted concentrated risks at the firm level.

### Risk Management

Multi-strategy funds typically have the largest and most complex risk management systems in the hedge fund industry:

- **Portfolio Manager Level**: Pre-defined investment scope, leverage, exposure, and drawdown limits.
- **Aggregate Level**: Monitoring of total leverage, unencumbered cash, VaR, DV01, CS01, factor exposures, and stress testing.
- **Intervention possible at central book level**.
Multi-strategy funds require substantial middle and back office resources to handle multi-asset, multi-counterparty operations.

## Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund Structure

### Management Structure

- Small funds: Operated by owners or a small number of partners;  
- Large funds: Multi-level management structure, potentially with multiple offices and business divisions globally.  
- **Internal and External Teams**: Traditional model keeps all managers in-house, while increasingly more funds collaborate with external teams through **SMA**. This combines the advantages of internal management and FoF.

### Culture/Collaboration

- Under the **pass-through fee** model, fund managers receive compensation based on their individual performance, potentially leading to more independent or competitive behavior;  
- Under the **traditional management fee + performance fee** structure, there may be greater emphasis on collaboration and maximizing overall company performance;  
- At the company level, there is typically a desire to encourage collaboration for better information sharing, while avoiding "groupthink."

### Scale and Expansion

- Diversified funds are generally larger than multi-focused ones, which in turn are larger than multi-opportunistic funds, though exceptions exist.
- **Multi-opportunistic** strategies are difficult to scale infinitely;
- **Diversified** strategies are the most scalable, but require simultaneous expansion of investment capabilities and infrastructure, balancing fundraising with strategy capacity.
- The most successful multi-strategy funds can raise or return capital at any time to maintain optimal size. Most others need to carefully weigh their options.
- Talent recruitment: Multi-strategy firms offer competitive fee structures for top talent, or attract/retain talent through upfront compensation, equity/partnership status, and other means.

### Related Terms

#### Fees

- Small-scale or single/few manager multi-strategy funds: Traditional management fee + performance fee.
- Diversified, multi-fund manager model: Primarily uses **pass-through fee** structure to ensure managers' incentives are directly linked to their own performance.

#### Liquidity

- The underlying liquidity depends on the strategy, but multi-strategy funds often set stricter liquidity terms than necessary to avoid forced liquidation during periods of stress.
- Investor dissatisfaction with liquidity terms may lead to redemptions in the long run, so fund management needs to strike a balance in the terms.
