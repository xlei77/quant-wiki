## Summary

Event-driven hedge funds focus on exploiting pricing inefficiencies caused by corporate events (such as mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, bankruptcies, or other significant corporate actions). This strategy identifies mispriced securities with favorable risk/return characteristics based on different views on value-release catalysts, event probabilities, and post-event valuations. The success of such strategies depends on managers' ability to accurately predict the outcomes of these corporate events and effectively manage associated risks.

In this article, we explored event-driven investing, providing insights into the most common event-driven strategies. For each strategy, we provided descriptions, example trades, and reviewed the historical performance of each strategy under different market conditions, considering the unique risk and return characteristics associated with these strategies.

The success of event strategies depends on managers' ability to accurately predict the outcomes of corporate events and effectively manage associated risks.

## What are Event-Driven Hedge Funds?

Event-driven hedge funds employ investment strategies that capitalize on opportunities created by specific corporate events. These events include mergers and acquisitions (M&A), spin-offs, restructurings, bankruptcies, and other significant corporate actions. The strategy involves analyzing potential outcomes of these events and their likely impact on related securities prices, taking advantage of market inefficiencies and special situations risks associated with these events.

Event-driven managers need deep understanding of event dynamics, regulatory environment, and potential market reactions to make informed investment decisions. This typically requires expertise and specialization in fundamental analysis, legal considerations, credit analysis, market dynamics, and corporate strategy. While event-driven strategies are primarily expressed through equities, credit instruments such as corporate bonds also feature in more credit-focused situations like bankruptcies, restructurings, and catalyst-driven credit rating upgrades or downgrades.

Event-driven strategies face specific risks related to their target events, including delays or failures due to regulatory hurdles, shareholder opposition, or unexpected changes in corporate strategy. Overall market conditions and economic factors also affect the success of event-driven strategies, particularly in volatile or uncertain market environments that may impact event completion feasibility. Assessing liquidity is crucial, as event-driven opportunities can attract many managers, leading to crowded trades. This risk has intensified in recent years with the proliferation of event-driven sub-strategies within multi-strategy fund structures.

## Most Common Event-Driven Strategies

Event-driven funds can be classified in various ways; however, the sub-strategy classification used in this primer aligns with that employed by Aurum's Hedge Fund Data Engine, as follows:

- Activism
- Merger Arbitrage
- Event - Multi-Strategy
- Event - Opportunistic

**Activism** managers are classified as event-driven because they actively seek to create catalysts that will increase shareholder value. They typically hold large positions in companies to influence management decisions and drive corporate actions such as restructurings, spin-offs, or changes in corporate governance.

**Merger Arbitrage** funds focus on capturing the spread between a target company's current market price and the agreed acquisition price in merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions. This spread reflects the market's assessment of the perceived risk and timing of deal completion, offering arbitrageurs the opportunity to profit from deal consummation.

**Event - Multi-Strategy** and **Event - Opportunistic** funds are characterized by their diversified approach, investing across multiple event-driven sub-strategies. In addition to activism and merger arbitrage, these funds may allocate capital to event-driven credit and special situations. The latter is a broad category encompassing various less obvious catalyst events, typically focusing on companies undergoing significant corporate or capital structure changes. Special situations may also include more arbitrage-oriented strategies such as share class arbitrage, dual-listed arbitrage, capital structure arbitrage, and holding company/stub value arbitrage. Event - Multi-Strategy and Event - Opportunistic funds may also deploy liquidity provision strategies, including index rebalancing and equity capital markets (ECM) strategies.

While both types of funds can dynamically allocate capital between sub-strategies, Event - Opportunistic funds are defined by their highly flexible and opportunistic approach. These funds may concentrate much or all of their risk in specific areas based on the current opportunity set. This approach differs from Event - Multi-Strategy funds, which typically maintain allocations across multiple sub-strategies with less frequent or less dramatic changes than Event - Opportunistic funds.

These funds may also allocate some of their capital to distressed credit situations, which can also be viewed as part of event-driven investing. However, if a majority of a fund's risk or P&L is consistently driven by this strategy, such funds will be classified under Aurum's Credit - Distressed Credit category.

Event-driven hedge fund strategies represent a relatively small share of the hedge fund space. According to Aurum's Hedge Fund Data Engine, these strategies account for approximately 10% of hedge fund industry assets. However, event strategies are also a major component of the larger multi-strategy space, typically representing 5-15% or more of overall allocations.

## Activism

### Description

Activist hedge funds invest substantial stakes in public companies with the aim of influencing corporate decisions and driving changes to enhance shareholder value. Unlike other hedge fund strategies that may also interact with management (such as distressed investing and certain special situations), activist managers specifically focus on being catalysts for change. They typically adopt a value-oriented mindset, with investment decisions usually based on deep fundamental analysis and a proactive approach to influencing company strategy. Activist strategies typically focus on:

- Operational improvements
- Capital structure optimization
- Strategic alternatives (such as M&A)
- Corporate governance reforms
- Shareholder-friendly policies (such as buybacks or dividends)

**Target Companies**

Activist hedge funds tend to target companies where they believe shareholder value can be enhanced through active engagement. These are typically companies that have made poor strategic decisions, have inefficient capital allocation, excessive executive compensation, or suboptimal governance structures. Conversely, they typically avoid companies where their ability to influence change is limited or where paths to value creation are unclear.

**Engagement Approaches**

Activist managers typically hold large equity positions to gain influence and can pursue either public campaigns or private negotiations to advocate for their proposed changes. The time horizon for activist investments may be longer than other hedge fund strategies, often spanning several years, as the process of implementing changes and realizing value can be lengthy.

**Risks and Challenges**

While the activist approach is associated with notable successes and high-profile campaigns, risks exist. Companies may resist changes, and public battles can be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, markets may not respond positively to activist interventions if proposed changes are viewed as too aggressive or detrimental to the company's long-term prospects.

**Historical Evolution**

Activist investing has evolved over the years, leading to distinctions in styles and approaches. Early activist investors of the 1980s and 1990s, often known as "corporate raiders," were known for hostile tactics and aggressive public campaigns. However, modern activists tend to adopt more collaborative and constructive approaches, seeking mutually beneficial outcomes through engagement with management. This evolution has led activist funds to diversify their strategies, combining traditional activism with elements of private equity and strategic consulting roles.

**Activist Short Sellers**

A unique sub-strategy worth highlighting separately includes **activist short sellers**; these managers aim to profit from expected declines in company stock prices. They typically publicize their research findings, highlighting issues such as accounting fraud, misleading disclosures, or unsustainable business models. Their reports can lead to immediate stock price declines in target companies, potentially damaging their market position and investor confidence.

While activist managers often generate controversy for their public criticism of management or other activist tactics, activist short sellers are particularly controversial due to their emphasis on short selling. These managers may face accusations of market manipulation and spreading negative information to depress company values. These strategies can lead to legal and ethical debates about their impact on market stability and corporate integrity. However, supporters argue that activist short selling helps improve market efficiency by exposing fraud or unethical behavior, thereby protecting investors and promoting transparency and price discovery.

### Example Campaign

In recent years, a high-profile activist campaign was **Elliott Investment Management L.P.**'s ("Elliott") 2020 campaign targeting tech giant Twitter. Due to the high-profile nature of both the target company and its influential CEO Jack Dorsey, this campaign attracted widespread attention.

**Campaign Overview:**

- **Share Accumulation**: Elliott initiated the campaign by disclosing a substantial stake in Twitter, reportedly around 4%, making it one of the largest shareholders.
- **Strategic Intent**: Elliott publicly pushed for changes aimed at enhancing shareholder value, including potentially replacing Jack Dorsey as CEO. They argued that Dorsey's dual CEO roles at both Twitter and Square, another company he co-founded, were not in the best interests of Twitter's shareholders.
- **Engagement Strategy**: The hedge fund reportedly engaged in private discussions with Twitter's board and management, advocating for operational improvements and a more focused leadership structure, and nominated four directors to Twitter's board.
- **Public Scrutiny**: The campaign received extensive media coverage and scrutiny due to Twitter's influence in social media and tech sectors, as well as the high-profile challenge to CEO leadership.
- **Outcome**: The campaign ultimately led to significant changes at Twitter. In November 2021, Jack Dorsey resigned as CEO. The leadership change was viewed as a partial success for Elliott, aligning with their goals of improving Twitter's governance and operational focus.

Elliott's activist campaign against Twitter demonstrates how hedge funds can strategically use their shareholdings to influence corporate governance and management decisions, aiming to unlock shareholder value.

### Performance in Different Markets

Activist strategies do not have a clear dividing line between favorable and unfavorable environments. However, the long-biased nature of the strategy means that overall stock market trends may play an important role in activist managers' performance. Broad upward trends in the stock market can support appreciation in target companies' stocks, enhancing the strategy's potential to generate returns. Conversely, market declines may reduce the value of activist holdings, making it more difficult to achieve expected returns and potentially extending the time needed for markets to recognize and reward the changes implemented through activism.

However, driving change can be more challenging in rising markets, as targets for unlocking significant value through activism become more difficult to find, and shareholders are less likely to be dissatisfied with current performance. Activist opportunities tend to be more abundant during periods of corporate distress, when companies may be more susceptible to activist pressure and more likely to accept demands for strategic changes.

Finally, industry-specific dynamics can affect the performance of activist strategies. Industries experiencing rapid technological change or regulatory disruption (such as technology, healthcare, consumer goods) typically offer more opportunities for activists to advocate for strategic shifts. In contrast, more stable or heavily regulated industries (such as utilities, financials, real estate) may present greater challenges to activist intervention, as strict regulations or policies may protect incumbent management and hinder activists' ability to drive change.

### Risk/Return Characteristics

Activist funds typically exhibit risk and return expectations at the higher end of event-driven strategies and broader hedge fund strategies. Key characteristics include:

- **Long Bias**: The strategy typically has a long bias, resulting in activist funds historically showing relatively high correlation with equity markets.
- **Concentrated Positions**: Activist funds typically manage highly concentrated, high-conviction positions. The substantial equity stakes required to drive change in target companies usually result in fewer positions, leading to lower diversification. This concentration can lead to higher volatility, as the performance of a few key positions can significantly impact overall fund returns.
- **Long-term Investment Horizon**: Holding periods spanning multiple years are not uncommon, as realizing value from positions often takes time. This long-term investment horizon may expose activist funds to extended market and company-specific risks, making the strategy susceptible to higher short-to-medium-term volatility and larger drawdowns.
- **Value Orientation**: The strategy tends to have a value-oriented investment bias. This value bias means the strategy may underperform during periods when value is out of favor (such as the decade following the Global Financial Crisis, when growth stocks significantly outperformed value stocks).
- **Headline Risk**: Activist funds are susceptible to headline risk, where negative media coverage or public scrutiny of their activities can affect the perception and performance of their investments. This risk can lead to increased volatility and potential drawdowns as market sentiment can quickly turn on adverse news.
- **Crowding**: Activist funds often share similar investment universes, leading to potentially concentrated positions. This overlap can amplify the aforementioned risks and result in increased volatility in stocks that attract multiple activist investors.

In summary, while activist strategies have the potential to generate substantial returns by driving significant changes in target companies, the strategy may be susceptible to higher volatility and larger drawdowns due to its combination of directional equity market exposure, position concentration, long holding periods, and value-oriented bias. Additionally, due to the strategy's long bias, a significant portion of activist fund returns can be attributed to beta rather than alpha generation.

## Merger Arbitrage

### Description

Merger arbitrage hedge funds focus on capturing the spread between the current market price of target company stocks and the agreed acquisition price in merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions. The strategy typically involves buying the target company's stock after the acquisition announcement and selling it upon deal completion, thus capturing the difference between these two prices. This spread reflects the market's perceived risk and time to deal completion, offering arbitrageurs an opportunity to profit from deal consummation. Key factors affecting this spread include:

- **Deal Completion Risk**: The spread compensates for the possibility that the transaction may not complete as planned. Factors such as regulatory approvals, shareholder votes, and antitrust issues affect this risk. The higher the perceived risk, the wider the spread.
- **Time Value of Money**: Since merger arbitrage involves waiting for deal completion, the spread includes a premium for the time value of money. The longer the expected time to completion, the wider the spread to compensate for the opportunity cost of tied-up capital. Current interest rates can significantly impact this aspect.
- **Market Sentiment and Volatility**: Market conditions and sentiment toward specific deals or broader markets can affect spreads. Increased market volatility or negative sentiment toward a deal may widen spreads due to heightened uncertainty.
- **Competing Bids and Deal Revisions**: The possibility of competing bids or deal term revisions can impact spreads. If rumors suggest another company might make a higher offer, the target's stock price might rise, narrowing the spread or even trading through the initial offer price, known as "trading through the terms."
- **Arbitrageur Demand and Market Composition**: Once a deal is announced, the composition of buyers and sellers in the target stock changes dramatically. Arbitrageurs become the primary traders while "real money" investors tend to avoid these situations. This change in market participants results in target stock prices becoming highly sensitive to arbitrageur supply and demand dynamics. When many merger arbitrage managers target the same stock, high arbitrageur demand for target shares may narrow spreads, while lower interest may widen them. Thus, the main buyers and sellers, primarily arbitrageurs, significantly influence post-announcement price dynamics.

The merger financing method—cash, stock, or a combination—determines how merger arbitrage funds structure their trades. In all-cash financed deals, merger arbitrage managers typically establish long positions in target company stock, buying shares at current market prices expecting the acquisition to complete at the higher agreed cash price, capturing the spread as profit. In all-stock deals, where the acquisition is financed with acquirer's stock, merger arbitrage funds establish long positions in target company stock and corresponding short positions in acquirer stock. This short position hedges against fluctuations in acquirer stock price that might affect deal value. By shorting acquirer stock, arbitrageurs aim to lock in the spread's value according to the exchange ratio specified in the merger agreement.

Historically, merger arbitrage was primarily implemented by proprietary trading desks at large financial institutions. However, with regulatory changes, particularly the Volcker Rule restricting proprietary trading activities, hedge funds have become the primary practitioners of the strategy, operating as standalone merger arbitrage funds or as sub-strategies within broader event-driven or multi-strategy funds.

Geographically, merger arbitrage funds tend to focus primarily on U.S. markets or global markets with a U.S. emphasis, given high levels of M&A activity, transparent regulatory environments, and high liquidity. While some managers focus on European markets, there are relatively fewer merger arbitrage funds focused on Asia.

Given the strategy's mature and formulaic nature, merger arbitrage increasingly employs quantitative, rules-based frameworks for implementation. These frameworks identify and engage in deals based on predefined characteristics such as deal size, acquirer rationale, market capitalization, geography, and industry. Consequently, the strategy has come to be viewed as somewhat commoditized over time, with returns generally considered an alternative risk premium best captured systematically. However, despite the trend toward systematization, merger arbitrage remains predominantly discretionary. The complexity of evaluating unique deal characteristics, such as corporate synergies or antitrust risk, typically requires discretionary judgment and expertise.

### Example Trade

One recent high-profile merger arbitrage trade involved Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In January 2022, Microsoft announced its intention to acquire the gaming giant for $68.7 billion, making it one of the largest transactions in the tech industry. Microsoft agreed to purchase Activision Blizzard at $95 per share with an all-cash financing structure. The acquisition aimed to strengthen Microsoft's gaming portfolio and solidify its position in the rapidly growing gaming sector.

- **Merger arbitrage funds** reportedly purchased Activision Blizzard stock at current market prices below the agreed acquisition price of $95 per share. The goal was to profit from the spread between the market price and the acquisition price, assuming the deal would close.
- **The deal faced** intense regulatory scrutiny from antitrust authorities in the US, EU, and UK, with concerns about potential impacts on competition in the gaming industry. This regulatory uncertainty led to volatility in Activision Blizzard's stock price.
- **Arbitrageurs closely monitored** the regulatory approval process, market reactions, and legal challenges. The uncertainty and associated volatility in Activision Blizzard's stock price created opportunities for arbitrage profits.
- **Despite** initial regulatory hurdles, the deal received approval from various authorities and closed in October 2023.

This example transaction highlights the complexities of merger arbitrage, particularly in managing regulatory risks and continuously assessing deal completion probability in highly scrutinized industries.

### Performance in Different Markets

Merger arbitrage is one of the most enduring hedge fund sub-strategies. Some experts have successfully operated merger arbitrage funds for over 30 years, which speaks to the persistence of the phenomena this strategy seeks to monetize.

As a strategy that depends on corporate deal completion, merger arbitrage funds' performance largely depends on their ability to accurately assess and manage idiosyncratic risks associated with individual deals, primarily the probability of completion and potential delays or deal failures. However, the strategy's opportunity set is heavily influenced by the level of M&A activity. Merger arbitrage funds perform well in environments with high M&A volume, as the number of deals not only increases opportunities for capital deployment but also allows for better portfolio diversification, potentially reducing the impact of any single deal failure on the overall portfolio. Conversely, the strategy may face challenges during economic downturns or when external shocks disrupt the M&A landscape. Fewer deals lead to fewer arbitrage opportunities, resulting in increased crowding within existing deals, which can compress spreads.

Current interest rate levels also create interesting dynamics for the strategy's performance. Higher rates increase corporate borrowing costs, making leveraged transactions more expensive and typically leading to reduced M&A activity. However, higher rates also lead to wider spreads as investors typically demand higher risk premiums above the risk-free rate to compensate for increased opportunity costs of capital and higher perceived risks. Conversely, low-rate environments typically encourage M&A activity but also result in tighter spreads due to lower required premiums above risk-free rates. Thus, the net impact of rates on strategy performance is multifaceted, influenced by the balance between M&A activity volume and spread levels.

Finally, environments with enhanced regulatory and political scrutiny can present challenges for the strategy. Antitrust issues are particularly influential, as regulators such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and European Commission have become more active in reviewing and potentially blocking mergers they deem would reduce competition or harm consumers. This enhanced scrutiny can lead to longer approval processes, higher probabilities of deal failure, and wider spreads to compensate for increased risks. Geopolitical factors can further complicate the environment, as changes in trade policies, tariffs, and economic sanctions between nations can affect the feasibility and attractiveness of cross-border transactions. This is particularly prevalent between the U.S. and China, where increased regulatory scrutiny has blocked or challenged several high-profile deals in recent years (such as Xilinx/AMD in 2022, Qualcomm/Broadcom in 2018).

### Risk/Return Characteristics

The risk and return characteristics of merger arbitrage are primarily driven by the outcomes of individual merger transactions rather than broader market movements. As such, the strategy is generally considered market neutral, although the underlying trade structures are typically long-biased, particularly in cash deals involving long-only positions in target companies without corresponding short legs. Consequently, merger arbitrage can maintain market non-correlation during periods of market volatility or decline, as the strategy's performance is more closely tied to merger outcomes. However, extreme market selloffs and heightened volatility can significantly impact the strategy, as the viability and completion of certain deals may be threatened, and mark-to-market fluctuations in spreads may become large enough to necessitate further risk reduction, potentially exacerbating losses.

Compared to activist funds, merger arbitrage funds typically target more conservative returns but generally experience lower volatility and smaller drawdowns. This can lead to better risk-adjusted performance. Like many arbitrage strategies, merger arbitrage may exhibit negatively skewed return characteristics, as small, steady returns from deal completion are pursued against the risk of substantial potential losses from adverse events such as deal breaks or regulatory intervention. This asymmetry highlights the importance of trade selection and position sizing to ensure portfolio diversification and reduce the impact of any single deal break on overall performance.

Crowding is also a significant risk factor for the strategy. Given the well-defined deal universe, merger arbitrage funds typically share similar investment universes, which can lead to position crowding and common factor risks. During adverse deal scenarios, simultaneous liquidations by multiple funds can exacerbate selling pressure and compound losses. Additionally, the strategy's increased deployment within multi-strategy funds' pod structures, operating under more stringent risk management frameworks, has made forced liquidations more common. These necessary risk reduction actions, while managing overall portfolio volatility, can lead to significant spread volatility during pod liquidation periods.

The well-defined deal universe also results in high homogeneity among merger arbitrage funds, with strategy correlations among the highest relative to other hedge fund strategies.

Managers can differentiate themselves from peers in several ways. Some prefer to actively trade around deal and event milestones, such as regulatory approval announcements, shareholder vote outcomes, or other milestones that may impact deal completion. Others focus on more complex or less-known jurisdictions, navigating unique regulatory and market environments to find opportunities overlooked by competitors. Additionally, some managers are willing to short deal positions, which is uncommon in merger arbitrage given historically high completion rates for announced deals. However, shorting can be an attractive feature, providing upside asymmetry and hedging during deal breaks or broader spread widening.

## Events - Multi-Strategy

### Description

Event - Multi-Strategy funds are characterized by their diversified approach, investing across multiple event-driven sub-strategies. While activism and merger arbitrage are distinct components within this spectrum, these funds typically allocate across multiple event-oriented sub-strategies, most notably merger arbitrage, event-driven credit, and special situations. The latter is a broad category encompassing various less obvious catalyst events, typically focusing on companies undergoing significant corporate or capital structure changes. Additionally, special situations often include more arbitrage-oriented strategies such as share class arbitrage, dual-listed arbitrage, capital structure arbitrage, and holding company/stub value arbitrage. Event - Multi-Strategy funds may also deploy liquidity provision strategies, including index rebalancing and equity capital markets (ECM) strategies.

Event - Multi-Strategy funds are typically composed of multiple portfolio managers or portfolio management teams/"pods," each focusing on a distinct event-driven sub-strategy. While capital allocation between strategy areas can be dynamically adjusted based on the current opportunity set, changes tend to be less frequent or dramatic than funds categorized in the Event - Opportunistic category (see below).

#### Deployed Strategies

Events - Multi-strategy hedge funds invest in numerous event-driven sub-strategies. In addition to activism and merger arbitrage that have been detailed in this primer, other strategies include:

##### Event-Driven Credit

A strategy that focuses on opportunities arising from specific credit-related catalyst events, typically in distressed or technical credit situations. Positions are usually concentrated on balance sheet repair events, such as bond refinancing events, bond covenant provisions, capital restructuring (equity issuance, debt-to-equity conversion), and reorganization events (asset divestitures), as well as catalyst-driven credit rating upgrades or downgrades.

##### Special Situations

Encompasses various types of trading strategies focusing on companies undergoing significant changes in corporate structure (spin-offs, asset sales/divestitures, management changes) or capital structure (rights issues, special dividends, share buybacks). These situations are typically complex and require in-depth understanding of specific events and their potential future impact on the company.

##### Share Class Arbitrage

Profit from price differences between different classes of shares issued by the same company. Companies may issue different share classes to maintain control (e.g., non-voting shares vs. common shares), satisfy investor preferences (e.g., non-voting shares with higher dividends), or address regulatory and tax considerations. These share classes may trade at different prices due to their unique characteristics and/or temporary supply-demand imbalances, with price convergence typically occurring around corporate events. A key risk of this strategy is the potential for prolonged misalignment or further price divergence due to the non-fungibility of different classes, especially in the absence of clear convergence catalysts.

##### Dual-Listed Arbitrage

Profiting from price differences between stocks of the same company listed on different stock exchanges. These differences may arise due to supply and demand disparities between the two markets, currency fluctuations, market sentiment, and variations in trading costs. Executing different parts of trades across different time zones is typically not simultaneous, introducing "leg risk," where market prices for one or more expected components may become unfavorable during the time taken to complete the various orders.

##### Capital Structure Arbitrage

Takes advantage of valuation discrepancies between different securities in a company's capital structure, spanning across debt and equity. This strategy targets situations where the market prices of these securities are considered mispriced relative to their risk and return characteristics. Price convergence typically occurs around corporate events (such as debt restructuring, stock issuance, or credit rating changes) that may realign the valuation of company securities.

##### Holding Company/Residual Value Arbitrage

Profit from price discrepancies between a holding company's market value and the combined value of its underlying subsidiaries. This strategy typically focuses on the "residual" value—the portion of the holding company's valuation not accounted for by its listed assets, targeting situations where the holding company's stock trades at a discount relative to the sum of its parts. This is often triggered by corporate events such as upcoming spin-offs, asset sales, or divestitures that may unlock residual value or lead to valuation adjustments.

##### Index Rebalancing

This strategy aims to capitalize on predictable price movements of stocks being added to, deleted from, or reweighted within major stock indices (such as S&P 500, FTSE 100, or Russell 2000). Index providers periodically update their constituents based on criteria such as market capitalization, liquidity, and sector representation. The strategy involves anticipating the buying and selling pressure from passive investors (such as index funds) as they adjust their portfolios to reflect changes in index composition. Stocks being added to an index or receiving increased weights typically rise in price due to increased demand, while stocks being deleted or receiving reduced weights typically fall due to anticipated selling. The strategy requires precise timing and execution to manage risks associated with market impact, factor exposure (particularly momentum), and crowding, as hedge funds themselves may become marginal buyers of target stocks, potentially diminishing the strategy's effectiveness.

##### Equity Capital Markets (ECM)

Strategies focusing on opportunities created by Equity Capital Markets (ECM) activities, such as Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), follow-on offerings, and block trades. These events can create short-term price movements and inefficiencies, providing alpha-generating opportunities for hedge funds. Strong capital market relationships are crucial for securing IPO allocations, participating in secondary offerings, and accessing block trades (i.e., large volumes of shares sold at a discount in off-market transactions). Additionally, some funds aim to short stocks in anticipation of secondary offerings or block trades, intending to close positions after price declines due to equity dilution or temporary excess supply.

### Performance in Different Markets

By allocating capital across multiple event-driven strategies, event multi-strategy funds aim to deliver diversified returns with relatively low volatility across various market environments. Many underlying sub-strategies, particularly those focused on liquidity provision, can be highly cyclical. They have the potential to generate strong uncorrelated returns when market conditions are favorable but may struggle to produce alpha during quiet periods (for example, when ECM lacks trading flow or outside major index rebalancing windows).

Furthermore, special situations and event arbitrage-oriented sub-strategies tend to be highly opportunistic. These strategies typically aim to capitalize on temporary opportunities, and the potential trading universe for dual-listed arbitrage, share class arbitrage, and holding company/stub value arbitrage has decreased in recent years as companies take steps to simplify their capital structures. Therefore, the broad coverage of event multi-strategy funds aims to capitalize on various event-driven scenarios, somewhat mitigating the impact of cyclicality and opportunistic nature of individual strategies.

### Risk/Return Characteristics

Event-Multi Strategy funds typically offer moderate but stable returns with low volatility due to their diversified approach across multiple event-driven sub-strategies. The distinctions between funds within this category usually depend on their selection and weighting of event-driven sub-strategies, the level of leverage employed, and their tolerance for broader equity market beta exposure.

That said, the risk/return characteristics of these funds are primarily driven by their ability to generate alpha from special events. Consequently, a significant portion of Event-Multi Strategy funds' returns is attributed to alpha rather than beta.

## Event - Opportunism

### Description

Event - Opportunistic hedge funds share similarities with Event - Multi-Strategy classifications but are characterized by their highly flexible and opportunistic approach. These funds will more dynamically adjust their capital allocation across multiple event-driven strategies and may concentrate a majority or even all of their risk in specific areas, including event-driven credit, equity capital markets, or index rebalancing, based on the current opportunity set. This approach differs from Event - Multi-Strategy funds, which typically maintain allocations across multiple sub-strategies with less frequent or less dramatic changes than Event - Opportunistic funds.

These funds are typically (though not exclusively) managed by a single Chief Investment Officer or Portfolio Manager who engages in various strategies as opportunities arise. The defining characteristic of these funds is their ability to rapidly shift capital to areas of greatest opportunity while maintaining underweight positions or avoiding less favorable strategies.

### Performance in Different Markets

Event-Opportunistic hedge funds, like Event-Multi-Strategy funds, aim to provide diversified returns across various market environments. However, due to their more flexible and concentrated approach, there are some distinctions in their performance characteristics.

By dynamically allocating capital among multiple event-driven strategies, Event-Opportunistic funds seek to capitalize on the best opportunities available at any given time. This flexibility allows them to potentially generate stronger returns relative to Event-Multi-Strategy funds when market conditions favor their overweighted sub-strategies. For example, these funds might concentrate their risk in event-driven credit during post-crisis periods, or focus on ECM during periods of significant capital markets activity, aiming to fully capture and maximize returns from these opportunities.

### Risk/Return Characteristics

Event-opportunistic hedge funds typically offer potentially higher returns and moderate to high volatility due to their highly flexible and sometimes concentrated event-driven strategic approach. Consequently, the Sharpe ratios of these funds can vary significantly, depending on current market conditions and the fund's ability to capitalize on specific opportunities. However, due to their higher tolerance for strategy concentration, these funds may experience higher volatility and larger potential drawdowns when scenarios don't unfold as expected. This results in a more variable risk/return profile compared to event-multi-strategy funds, reflecting their opportunistic nature and dynamic strategy adjustments.
