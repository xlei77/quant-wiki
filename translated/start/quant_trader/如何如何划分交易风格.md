# A Quantitative Trader's Guide: How to Classify Trading Styles?

![](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/bucketio/img9@main/2024/10/20/1729465031968-b3c8959e-1d37-4b8a-91b1-b0b0dfe25143.png)

In the field of investment and trading, you often hear about various "styles": some focus on "Buy & Hold", some engage in High Frequency Trading daily, some pursue Trend Following, while others specialize in Contrarian trading... Different styles have distinctly different underlying logic, trading frequencies, and risk characteristics.

Below, I'd like to share a more detailed classification of "trading styles" to help you better understand your own or others' trading methods, particularly their potential **risk and return** characteristics.

## 1. Static vs. Dynamic

### 1. Static Strategy

- **Definition**: After purchase, minimal changes are made. Returns and risks primarily come from the held assets themselves.
- **Common Forms**:
  - **Buy & Hold**: Simply buying stocks or ETFs with no subsequent trading.
  - **Fixed Proportion Rebalancing**: If one asset rises significantly while another falls, sell some of the higher performer and buy more of the lower performer to maintain the predetermined ratio.
  - **Risk Parity**: Beyond maintaining market value balance, also maintains balance in risk contribution based on recent volatility or standard deviation of assets.

> For example, if you bought Apple and Microsoft stocks, initially planning to allocate half of the market value to each. Later, if Apple's stock price doubles while Microsoft's halves, rebalancing would mean selling some Apple shares and buying Microsoft shares to restore the 50-50 market value split.

#### Concept: Risk

Risk is a multi-layered term, and here we primarily use "price volatility over the recent period" as a simple estimate. This estimation ignores extreme events and unexpected changes that are "outside the model." It can help us quantify recent market daily fluctuations but cannot guarantee capturing "unknown unknowns."

### 2. Dynamic Strategy (Dynamic)

- **Definition**: More actively buying and selling, aiming to gain additional returns from market fluctuations.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Requires explicit trading rules or personal judgment;
  - Returns (or losses) come from the difference between asset "purchase price" and "selling price", as well as market performance during the holding period;
  - May encounter higher transaction costs and execution challenges.

> Dynamic strategies seek opportunities in market volatility but must handle more complex risk control and cost issues. For some investors, the difference between static and dynamic might just be a matter of degree - rebalancing at high frequencies starts to take on a somewhat "dynamic" character.

## II. The Non-Negligible Skew

In previous articles, I've mentioned "skewness" several times. Let me emphasize again: besides "returns" and "volatility," your strategy may exhibit **positive skew** or **negative skew**.

- **Positive skew**: Frequent small losses with occasional massive gains; similar to "buying insurance" where you pay premiums regularly, but when a real incident occurs, you can make substantial profits at once.
- **Negative skew**: Small profits most of the time, with occasional large losses. Appears "stable" normally, but a single extreme event can result in devastating losses.
- This is very similar to "selling vs. buying insurance": **Insurance sellers** typically earn steady income, but one natural disaster can wipe out all their capital.

> Quote: If you find your trading strategy making small profits almost daily but occasionally experiences a major crash, it likely has a "negative skew" structure.

---

## III. Trading Speed: From Ultra-Slow to High-Frequency

### 1. Ultra-Slow Type (Holding Period: Several Months to Years)

- **Characteristics**: Almost like "buy and hold," with very limited "excess returns" from dynamic trading.
- **Disadvantages**: Low trading frequency leads to fewer independent bets, making it theoretically difficult to significantly improve the Sharpe ratio.
- **Suitable Scenarios**: When trading costs are high or market liquidity is insufficient, long-term investment is preferable to low-frequency dynamic strategies.

> Quote: The **Law of Active Management** tells us that the more trades we make, the higher the risk-adjusted returns we can theoretically achieve (of course, considering costs). If you only trade once a year, it's difficult to accumulate enough "independent bets."

### 2. Medium Frequency (Holding Period: Hours to Months)

- **Characteristics**: The most common interval for quantitative or semi-automated trading, such as trend following, mean reversion, and relative value strategies on daily charts.
- **Advantages**: Higher trading frequency allows for more effective use of market volatility, and strategies can be more easily validated through backtesting.
- **Limitations**: Requires accurate estimation of trading costs, as market maker commissions and slippage have significant impact on returns.

> These strategies are more suitable for retail investors or small-to-medium-sized funds, without requiring expensive hardware or complex high-frequency channels.

### 3. High-Frequency and Ultra-High-Frequency Trading (Holding Period: Intraday to Milliseconds)

- **Characteristics**: Large volume of trades in short time periods, ideally can achieve very high Sharpe ratios;
- **Barriers**: Requires specialized execution algorithms, hardware (co-location services, etc.), and relatively higher trading costs;
- **Risks**: Technical failures and extreme market conditions can instantly wipe out previously accumulated small profits.

## IV. Technical vs. Fundamental Analysis

- **Technical Analysis**: Based solely on quantifiable trading data such as price and volume;
- **Fundamental Analysis**: Makes decisions by examining macroeconomic indicators (GDP, inflation, etc.) or company financial data (P/E ratio, debt structure, etc.).
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both methods to increase analytical dimensions.

> Technical systems are easier to implement; however, in certain areas, incorporating fundamental analysis can bring significant improvements in returns. Nevertheless, this also means higher costs for data acquisition and processing.

---

## V. Portfolio Scale: Single vs Multiple Instruments

- **Single Instrument**: Allows for high focus, traders can deeply research one market. However, when problems arise, there's no diversification protection.
- **Multiple Instruments**: Allocating across multiple markets or assets simultaneously. If these assets have low correlation, it can improve the portfolio's overall Sharpe ratio.
- **Diversification**: Theoretically, spreading capital across multiple uncorrelated instruments can significantly reduce portfolio volatility and improve risk-adjusted returns.

> Quote: A portfolio containing multiple asset classes like stocks, bonds, commodities, and forex tends to have more controllable risk than trading just one asset class. However, small accounts may face margin and commission constraints that limit effective diversification.

---

## VI. Leverage: Performance Amplifier or Potential Disaster?

**Leverage** can help amplify your returns, but it can also magnify losses.

- **Suitable Scenarios**: When an asset class has both low volatility and low returns, leverage is needed to achieve target returns;
- **Source of Danger**: When extreme market conditions occur, the higher the leverage ratio, the greater the risk of margin calls or forced liquidation;
- **Note**: Particularly when negative skewness strategies are combined with leverage, they often accumulate small profits during "calm waters" but can suddenly implode when major disruptions occur.

> For example, if you believe 4-year and 5-year Greek government bonds are highly correlated, you might execute a relative value trade: long the 4-year and short the 5-year. However, if market structure changes and these two bonds experience extreme price divergenceâ€”under high leverage, you could suffer severe losses instantly.

---

## VII. Trend Following vs. Contrarian: Which Camp Are You In?

- **Contrarian**: Prefers "buying dips" or bottom-fishing, based on mean reversion or relative value logic.
  - **Return Structure**: Mostly small profits, but occasionally may suffer a huge loss (negative skewness).
- **Trend Following**: Increases positions during uptrends and cuts losses during downtrends.
  - **Return Structure**: Multiple small losses most of the time, occasionally capturing major market moves for high returns (positive skewness).

> Quote: When most market participants are implementing the same trend following or contrarian strategy, we call it "Crowded trades". Once the market experiences violent reverse movements, the stampede effect gets amplified, such as LTCM's collapse in 1998 and the "Quant Quake" event in 2007.

## Summary & Recommendations

1. **Static vs. Dynamic**: From "buy and hold" to frequent trading, different strategies yield vastly different returns and risks.
2. **Don't Ignore Skewness**: Positive skewness is like buying insurance, negative skewness is like selling insurance; both can be profitable, but the key is whether you can handle concentrated risk events.
3. **Trading Frequency**: More frequent trading requires stricter cost control and technical support, while low-frequency trading faces challenges of insufficient independent bets and difficulty in improving returns.
4. **Data Sources**: Price-only strategies are easier to implement, while incorporating macro or company fundamentals data may improve strategy robustness but adds complexity.
5. **Portfolio Size**: Diversification helps improve the Sharpe ratio, but must balance capital size, management effort, and market capacity.
6. **Leverage**: Not entirely useless, but requires understanding of how to control and respond to sudden market movements. Be especially cautious with strategies that appear stable but harbor hidden negative skewness.
7. **Trend-Following vs. Mean-Reversion**: Understand whether you prefer to "catch falling knives" or "sail with the wind"; be particularly careful with homogeneous "crowded trades."

> Quote: These categories are not mutually exclusive. You can trade multiple instruments, use technical indicators in the medium-frequency range, and incorporate some fundamental logic; you can also combine "static" and "dynamic" components within the same strategy. The key is to understand which type of risk and return structure your strategy belongs to, and be prepared both mentally and financially for potential extreme scenarios.
