# Quantitative Trader's Guide: How to Build "Effective" Trading Strategies?

![](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/bucketio/img9@main/2024/10/20/1729465031968-b3c8959e-1d37-4b8a-91b1-b0b0dfe25143.png)

In this article, I want to explore a fundamental question with everyone â€” **What makes a trading rule good?** This is primarily aimed at readers who rely on **quantitative trading**.

## 1. Where Trading Rules Come From: Two Approaches

### "Data First" vs. "Ideas First"

Systematic trading is based on one premise: **the future will be similar to the past**. We hope to find effective rules in historical data and expect them to work in the future as well. However, there are two common approaches to finding rules that have been profitable historically:

1. **Data First**: Directly "mine" (data mining) patterns from historical data that appear profitable, then exploit them.
2. **Ideas First**: First propose a hypothesis supported by logic or theory, then use data to verify whether it's truly effective.

> "I believe foreign exchange rates are mainly influenced by interest rates, so I first hypothesize that 'interest rate differentials drive exchange rate movements,' then use data to test it."
> This is a typical example of "ideas first"; as Leda Braga, head of Systematica hedge fund, says, they first have a hypothesis, then conduct data analysis, rather than blindly looking for inspiration in the data.

#### Which Method is Better?

| **Theory First**                                                                         | **Data First**                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| - If the reasoning is correct, extensive and complicated "fitting" operations are often unnecessary. | - In "theory first," one might unconsciously only verify "market-popular" rules, which itself can lead to overfitting.    |
| - Due to relatively limited testing space, the risk of overfitting is smaller.           | - In "theory first," people might keep trying new ideas until finding one that makes money, which is another form of overfitting. |
| - Rules are usually simpler, easier to understand, and come with built-in "stories."     | - All fitting in "data first" is explicit, making it easier to control the degree of overfitting.                        |
| - With reasonable explanations, it's usually easier to identify the source of profits.   | - A good story doesn't guarantee repeated profits and might give you a "false sense of security" (narrative bias).       |
| - More suitable for researchers and traders who want to clearly understand profit sources. | - "Data first" might also uncover unexpected new patterns, leading to breakthrough "black box" strategies.                |

> Quote: Personally, I prefer the "theory first" approach because it helps me better understand why I'm making money and makes it easier to avoid meaningless overfitting. On the other hand, in certain high-frequency trading areas where market structure changes rapidly and data volume is large, "data first" might be more appropriate.

## 2. Why We Need to Understand the Source of Profits in Trading Rules

If we understand why a certain rule was profitable in the past, we can roughly predict whether it will remain profitable in the future and when it might become ineffective.

- **Idea First**: As long as the idea itself contains the reason for profitability (e.g., "people are reluctant to cut losses due to cognitive bias"), an intuitive explanation can be provided.
- **Data First**: This requires first finding profitable rules, then reverse engineering the underlying reasons. Complex data-driven strategies often make it difficult to explain why they are effective.

> Note: We need to be wary of "narrative fallacy." Humans like "stories that sound reasonable," but this doesn't mean the rule will stand up to statistical testing.

If I want to fully trust a trading rule, I hope it has both a solid data backtest and a self-consistent story - neither can be missing.

## 3. More Reliable Strategies Are Those That Are "Instantly Understandable"

Sometimes, we need to quickly assess whether a strategy's behavior "meets expectations" in practical operations. For example, if Unilever's stock price starts rising before the company's earnings report, a trend-following system would likely take a long position. If you see it taking a short position instead, you should suspect whether there's a data error or software bug.

However, if the rules are overly complex, small details might lead to decisions that are difficult to understand at certain moments. This not only makes troubleshooting difficult but also increases decision-making uncertainty.

## 4. Keep Rules "Simple" When Possible

I particularly prefer rules that are concise in design and clear in logic. They have stronger **interpretability** and are less likely to fall into overfitting caused by "continuously adding parameters."

- **Idea First**: As long as your initial concept isn't too complex, the resulting rules tend to remain concise.
- **Data First**: This approach can easily lead to adding numerous parameters in pursuit of higher returns, resulting in overly complicated strategies that are both difficult to explain and more likely to fail.

Of course, complexity isn't necessarily bad, and some advanced data mining techniques can uncover patterns that "simple rules" cannot discover. However, such strategies require more time to validate their stability and scope of application.

## 5. Can it be Systematized?

If a strategy cannot be written in a quantifiable, programmable form, it is difficult to truly become part of **systematic trading**.

1. **Too Subjective**: Some analytical methods rely too heavily on personal experience and intuition, making them difficult to "objectively quantify." For example, extremely complex candlestick patterns, or qualitative judgments of regulatory and legal factors in merger arbitrage, are difficult to fully transform into rigorous algorithms.
2. **Data Limitations**: Some strategies require information that is not public or difficult to collect, such as legal details in merger cases. If data is incomplete or severely insufficient, effective backtesting becomes impossible.

Additionally, some emerging data sources (such as Twitter popularity or Google search indices) may sound cool, but lack sufficiently long historical windows for validation, easily falling into the trap of hype exceeding practical effectiveness.

---

## Summary

- **Idea-first** and **data-first** are two main approaches to building systematic trading rules. The key is to avoid overfitting and understand the source of profits.
- Trading rules that can **explain their profit logic** and demonstrate relatively stable performance in both backtesting and real markets are often more trustworthy.
- **Simple and understandable strategies** are easier to manage and debug, and usually have better explainability.
- **Data or information availability** determines whether a strategy can be systematized; if high-quality data is lacking, or if the strategy heavily relies on subjective judgment, it may only be semi-automated or purely manual.

These are my thoughts on "how to evaluate whether a trading rule is excellent." I hope this helps provide clearer thinking when building or evaluating strategies, helping you avoid unnecessary detours.
