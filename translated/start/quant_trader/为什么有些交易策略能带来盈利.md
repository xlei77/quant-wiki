Hello everyone, today I'd like to discuss a frequently mentioned yet difficult-to-explain topic - **why certain trading strategies or rules can generate profits**. This is crucial for every investor, whether you rely on **systematic** strategies or prefer **discretionary judgment**. Only by understanding your sources of returns and clearly identifying whether you possess certain "advantages" can you maintain a clearer mindset in financial markets.

Here, I will combine my personal experience to share some theoretical foundations and explain why certain specific assets, asset combinations, and even **dynamic trading rules** can generate profits.

## Risk Premium: Like Buying and Selling Insurance in the Market

I often use the analogy of "buying insurance" to explain the concept of Risk Premia:

- **Buying Insurance**: You continuously pay premiums, often taking small losses, but receive large payouts when real disasters strike.
- **Selling Insurance**: You regularly collect premiums, but may suffer a massive loss in extremely rare cases.

Similar characteristics exist in financial markets: some are willing to sacrifice a portion of returns to hedge against extreme risks (buying insurance), while others earn higher average returns by taking on occasional significant losses (selling insurance). If certain assets have higher exposure to specific risks, investing in them allows you to earn more from these risk premiums.

### Persistent Risk Premium

Some risk premiums can remain "always online." For example, compared to bonds, stocks typically provide **excess returns** to compensate for their volatility and higher risk exposure. Similarly, when investors use factors like "company size" and "book-to-market ratio" to construct **value strategies**, this is also a way to profit from specific risk premiums. Compared to short-term bonds, long-term bonds usually generate higher yields to compensate for the uncertainty of "longer lending periods."

### Dynamically Changing Risk Premiums

Risk premiums are not always stable. For example, John Paulson purchased mortgage credit default swaps (CDS) cheaply in 2006, which brought him enormous profits during the subsequent subprime crisis.

> In 2006, John Paulson bought CDS at low prices and earned billions of dollars during the 2007-2008 subprime crisis.

Additionally, when markets fall into panic, we can take advantage of the opportunity to buy high-quality assets at cheap prices.

This trading approach often falls under **mean reversion**—we assume that risk premiums and related asset prices may be undervalued or overvalued in extreme situations but will eventually return to a "reasonable" range. However, determining the "reasonable value" of premiums is not easy, and markets can deviate from this equilibrium for extended periods. Nevertheless, these fluctuations themselves still constitute an important source of profit.

## Skewness (Skew): A Key Factor Beyond the Sharpe Ratio

People typically focus on the **Sharpe Ratio (SR)** to measure "risk-adjusted returns." However, when two assets have the same Sharpe ratio, but one experiences small losses most of the time with occasional large gains, while the other has small gains most of the time with occasional large losses, they provide investors with very different risk experiences. This demonstrates the importance of **Skewness (Skew)**.

### Concept: Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe Ratio is typically defined as:

$$
\text{SR} = \frac{\text{回报率} - \text{无风险利率}}{\text{标准差}}
$$

> For derivatives traders, the risk-free rate has relatively limited impact; this is especially true in the post-2009 low interest rate environment.
> When calculating the Sharpe ratio using daily data and converting it to annualized figures, multiply by approximately 16 (assuming 256 trading days per year).

However, the Sharpe ratio assumes returns are symmetrically distributed, which many real-world assets do not conform to, so we need to study **Skew**.

### Concept: Skewness (Skew)

If an asset is more prone to "large downward movements" rather than "large upward movements" of equal magnitude, we say it has **negative skew**; conversely, it has **positive skew**.

- Stocks typically have **slight negative skew**;
- "Safe-haven assets" like gold and Swiss francs usually have **positive skew**, but not as extreme as options.

**Buying insurance** represents positive skew: frequent small losses (paying premiums) with occasional large gains from claims; **Selling insurance** represents negative skew: steady premium income most of the time, but occasional massive losses.

#### Table: Negative Skew vs. Positive Skew

|                                  | Negative skew | Positive skew |
| -------------------------------- | ------------: | ------------: |
| **Mean of daily returns**        | 0.4%          | 0.4%          |
| **Sigma of daily returns**       | 6.3%          | 6.3%          |
| **Annualised Sharpe ratio**      | 1.0           | 1.0           |
| **Skew of daily returns**        | -1.0          | 1.0           |
| **Median daily return**          | 1.4%          | -0.6%         |
| **Average Gain : Average Loss**  | 0.8           | 1.4           |
| **Hit rate (% of positive days)**| 59%           | 46%           |
| **Expected annual worst daily loss** | -22%       | -10%          |
| **Expected annual best daily gain**  | 10%        | 22%           |

As shown in the table, even with the same annualized Sharpe ratio, there are still significant differences in the drawdown distribution between negative skew and positive skew strategies.

> Many people cannot tolerate the "occasional big loss" characteristic of negative skew, which is why people prefer to buy various types of insurance. Positive skew, on the other hand, means small losses most of the time but occasional opportunities for big gains, which is particularly attractive to those seeking high-elasticity returns.

## Leverage: Those Who Can Borrow May Have Long-term Advantages

In ideal financial models, we can freely borrow money to amplify returns. However, in the real world, most retail investors and institutions are either unwilling or unable to use leverage, causing them to overlook assets with "high Sharpe ratios but low absolute returns"—since they cannot use leverage to enhance returns, they tend to prefer assets with "high absolute returns but high volatility," even if their Sharpe ratios may not be ideal.

Therefore, you often see **high-risk assets** dominating many investment portfolios, as seen in the 1999 tech stock bubble. Those who can use leverage might theoretically outperform non-leveraged groups in the long run. However, during extreme market downturns, margin calls and forced liquidations can trigger a "death spiral," causing years of profits to evaporate in a short time.

> In the subsequent "Volatility Targeting" section, we will explore how to use leverage more safely.

## Liquidity and Scale: Why Small Companies or Alternative Assets May Be More "Attractive"

- **Liquidity**: Institutional investors need large-volume trading and quick liquidation, favoring highly liquid markets, which naturally drives up the prices of these assets.
- **Size premium**: Compared to large companies, small companies typically have higher returns due to their small scale and low liquidity, but this comes with difficulty in trading or valuation opacity.
- **Alternative assets**: Similar logic applies to assets like real estate and venture capital investments. If you can accept long-term capital lock-up and lack of liquidity, you may receive additional returns.

These premiums change over time. For example, mortgage-related derivatives were highly sought after in late 2006, commanding high prices; just one year later, almost no one would take them, and willing buyers could enter at very cheap prices.

## When Others "Have to" Trade, There Are Opportunities

Some trades are not made for profit but due to policy or other purposes. For example, when a central bank wants to depreciate its currency, it can continuously intervene in the foreign exchange market as long as it can bear the associated costs.

> Countries like Switzerland and Japan have historically intervened in exchange rates for extended periods until one day the policy was abandoned, leading to sudden violent currency movements.

During these periods, those engaging in **foreign exchange carry trades** could easily profit until the situation suddenly reversed, resulting in massive losses (negative skewness).
Other examples include institutions forced to rebalance portfolios for tax or financial reporting requirements at year-end, insurance companies compelled to buy long-term bonds, and forced asset sales under large redemption pressures. When these forced trades are large enough, they can create "distortions" in market prices, leaving room for arbitrage.

Similarly, those willing to act as "liquidity providers" can earn spreads, but this is a typical **negative skewness** strategy—if extreme market conditions occur, a few violent fluctuations are enough to wipe out previously accumulated small profits.

## Entry Barriers, Effort and Costs

Additionally, some strategies require expensive upfront investments or extensive expertise, such as **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)** which requires renting server rooms near exchanges and developing ultra-fast software; investing in private companies also requires lengthy due diligence and legal preparations. These costs are substantial, so returns must correspondingly increase to compensate. This doesn't necessarily mean these individuals possess "amazing skills," but rather reflects the principle that "high input necessarily demands high returns."

## Behavioral Bias: Many People Would Rather Lose Money Than Change Their Habits

While classical financial theory can explain most phenomena, **cognitive biases** and **behavioral biases** exist in reality.

- Some regions prohibit short selling, which naturally distorts prices;
- People often overestimate low-probability events, such as buying lottery tickets, deeply out-of-the-money options, or persistently using certain technical indicators;
- Many people are reluctant to cut losses, yet are eager to frequently realize profitable positions...

These psychological and institutional factors may create persistent investment opportunities. For example: a "trend following" trading rule can exploit investors' momentum psychology (**prospect theory**) and often achieve fairly good returns.

### Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

Certain "metaphysical" technical analysis methods (such as Fibonacci sequences) lack rigorous academic backing, but because many traders collectively follow them, these key levels often do genuinely attract substantial buying and selling activity, creating a self-fulfilling effect. As for whether this remains effective in the long term? No one can guarantee that.

## Pure Alpha and Investment Skill: The Buffett Phenomenon

A very small number of individuals like Warren Buffett, John Templeton, and Peter Lynch seem to have achieved returns beyond all the theoretical frameworks mentioned above. They might be one-in-a-billion lucky individuals, or they might genuinely possess **Alpha**—true investment talent and skill.

The decision-making of such investors is often difficult to standardize or systematize, as they can respond flexibly to market changes. If you believe you belong in this category, you might want to try using **semi-automated** trading or decision support tools to enhance execution, but the key ultimately remains your personal judgment.
