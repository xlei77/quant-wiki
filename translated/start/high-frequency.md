## The Rise of Automated Trading: From Traditional to Low-Latency Architecture

Over the past decade, the rapid development of **Automated Trading** has dramatically transformed trading system structures and will continue to profoundly influence financial markets in the future. For companies engaged in high-frequency trading and similar activities, maintaining competitiveness in Algorithmic Trading requires continuous technological innovation.

In this article, we will systematically analyze the architecture behind automated trading systems, compare the differences between new system designs and traditional system designs, and explore how the key components of these systems work together.

## What is Automated Trading?

**Automated Trading System** is a fully automated trading approach and a subset of algorithmic trading. It not only uses computers to generate trading signals but also manages the execution process of orders in the market while minimizing human intervention.

In this process, automated trading also involves quantitative modeling and risk monitoring. Currently, an increasing number of market participants (trading firms, banks, hedge funds, asset management companies, pension funds, etc.) are adopting automated trading systems. The degree of automation in these systems is influenced by various factors including regulatory environment, exchange requirements, and cultural differences.

For beginners, automated trading can significantly simplify the complexity of trade execution. **"Getting Started with Automated Trading"** typically involves using user-friendly platforms with lower programming knowledge requirements, achieving efficient and disciplined trading with the help of preset rules and algorithms.

## Differences between Automated Trading and Algorithmic Trading

The following table lists the main differences between automated trading and algorithmic trading in various aspects:

| **Aspect**    | **Algorithmic Trading**                                                   | **Automated Trading**                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**| Trading signals (buy/sell decisions) are generated based on a set of algorithmic instructions | A subset of algorithmic trading where both signal generation and order execution are automatically completed by computers |
| **Purpose**   | Reduce human error, save time, minimize emotional interference             | Automate the entire trading process, from decision-making to execution, without needing to manually convert instructions into programming language |
| **Decision Making** | Relies on algorithms to determine how orders are executed            | Includes automated decision-making components and directly executes orders                                                 |

## Evolution of Trading Systems

Traditional trading systems primarily perform the following three interactive operations with exchanges:

1. Receive market data

![](https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/bucketio/img4@main/2025/02/11/1739307957995-88bebeac-5afe-4fd3-b29f-6462843ef338.png)

2. Send order requests
3. Receive confirmations from exchanges

In the early days, when traders needed to buy or sell stocks or other financial instruments, they had to place orders through brokers (individuals or companies). Brokers executed trades manually, which was not only time-consuming but also often influenced by emotions like fear and greed. Additionally, manual analysis had obvious accuracy limitations, and "nobody's perfect" meant that traditional trading methods were more prone to errors.

The emergence of **automated trading** made trading more precise, efficient, and responsive. Automated trading systems receive and analyze real-time data from exchanges (such as order books, trading volume, latest transaction prices, etc.), and combine historical data to infer trends and trading strategies. Finally, a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** is needed to allow traders to visually monitor market and account conditions.

## Why Do We Need Automated Trading Systems?

Compared to traditional architectures, automated trading systems using **Direct Market Access (DMA)** significantly reduce the latency between receiving market data and order placement, with this latency typically measured in milliseconds or even microseconds.

Additionally, to handle high-frequency order requests, automated trading systems must be more robust in order management and incorporate built-in risk management functions. When execution speed becomes this fast, thousands of trading decisions can be generated per second, requiring the system to complete risk assessments in extremely short timeframes, otherwise it could face potentially massive losses.

---

## Automated Trading System Architecture

Based on the above requirements, the traditional automated trading system architecture can typically be divided into the following components:

1. **Exchange (External World)**
2. **Server**
   - Receives and stores market data
   - Stores user-generated orders
3. **Application Layer**
   - User inputs (e.g., stop-loss settings, limit prices, financial instruments to trade, etc.)
   - Information visualization interface (displays data, order information, etc.)
   - Order manager, responsible for sending orders to the exchange

In this architecture, to prevent manual input errors by users (such as mistakenly entering "10000" instead of "100", known as **Fat Finger** errors), the application layer also takes on some risk control responsibilities. Additionally, the entire system is equipped with a more sophisticated **Risk Management System (RMS)**, which can be divided into **Strategy Level RMS (SLRMS)** and **Global RMS (GRMS)**, responsible for risk control of specific strategies and the overall portfolio respectively.

1. **Market Adapter**  
   Data formats from exchanges or third-party data providers may vary, so the system needs adapters to convert received market data into a unified format that the system can recognize. Exchanges typically provide **APIs** to assist in developing adapters.

2. **Complex Event Processing Engine (CEP)**  
   This is the "brain" of the strategy. After receiving data, it performs statistical analysis and decision-making based on historical and real-time data, generating order requests. **"Complex Events"** can be understood as real-time processing of a series of related events such as market trends, volatility, and news.  
   - CEP engine and CEP rules are core components; rules define how to process input events (such as market changes); the engine is responsible for executing these rules.  
   - For Quants, most time is spent on strategy design, backtesting, and optimization in this module.

3. **Order Manager**  
   The order manager receives trading instructions from CEP, performs risk checks (RMS), generates final orders, and sends them to the exchange.

## Protocols for Automated Trading Systems

Since the new architecture needs to support multiple strategies running on a single server and interface with multiple destinations (exchanges or data sources), the order manager must support various **adapters**. To connect to different exchanges or data providers, adapters must be written according to their respective protocols or APIs.

To simplify this process, **standardized protocols** have emerged in the industry, with the **FIX (Financial Information eXchange) Protocol** being the most common. With the FIX protocol, the cost of connecting to new exchanges or data sources is significantly reduced, and it also makes it easier for systems to interface with third-party analytical tools or market data sources.

**Paper trading** also benefits from standard protocols: systems can connect to simulators using the same interface without modifying internal logic. Additionally, it becomes easy to integrate historical data for backtesting to validate strategies.

## Towards Low-Latency Architecture

With the proliferation of automated trading and intensifying competition, reducing latency has become a focal point in the industry. Server hardware upgrades (larger memory, higher CPU frequencies) enable systems to process massive data and make quick decisions, but for high-frequency traders pursuing millisecond or even microsecond-level responses, you can never be **fast** enough.

**Latency reduction** involves various aspects throughout the entire trading process, such as:

1. Exchange market data packet publication
2. Data packet network transmission
3. Server-side routing processing
4. Market Adapter reception and data parsing
5. CEP strategy decision-making
6. Order generation and market return

> Latency at each stage accumulates, ultimately determining the final arrival speed of trading instructions. The industry-standard **Colocation** solution involves physically placing trading servers as close as possible to the exchange to minimize network transmission distance.

## Different Complexity Levels of Automated Trading

Intense competition in high-frequency algorithmic trading has led to rapid technological advancement, making modern automated trading system architectures much more complex than earlier versions and requiring higher investments (both in time and capital). Below are common Network Card choices and their impact on latency, development costs, and other aspects:

| **Aspect**                   | **Standard 10GE NIC**                | **Low-Latency 10GE NIC**              | **FPGA**                           | **ASIC**                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Latency**                  | ~20 microseconds + application time  | ~5 microseconds + application time     | 3-5 microseconds                    | Sub-microsecond                       |
| **Deployment Difficulty**    | Extremely simple                     | Requires kernel driver installation    | Requires programmer retraining      | Requires specialized expertise        |
| **Development Investment**   | Several weeks                        | Several weeks                         | Several months                      | 2-3 years of manpower                |

For individuals or small traders, building a complete high-level automated trading system may not be practical. Many **subscription-based** automated trading platforms are available in the market, where traders can write strategies or directly use built-in strategies, avoiding the hassle of building underlying infrastructure from scratch.
