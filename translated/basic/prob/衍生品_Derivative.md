## What are Derivatives?

The term "derivative" refers to a financial contract whose value depends on an underlying asset, portfolio of assets, or benchmark. Derivatives are established between two or more parties who can trade either on exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC).

These contracts can be used to trade any number of assets and carry their own risks. The price of derivatives comes from the volatility of the underlying asset. These financial securities are typically used to enter specific markets and can be traded to hedge risks. Derivatives can be used to mitigate risk (hedging) or take on risk with the expectation of corresponding returns (speculation). Derivatives can transfer risk (and the accompanying returns) from risk-averse parties to risk-seeking parties.

- The price of derivatives comes from fluctuations in the underlying asset.
- Derivatives are typically leveraged instruments, which increases their potential risks and returns.
- Common derivatives include futures contracts, forward contracts, options, and swaps.

## Understanding Derivatives

Derivatives are complex financial securities established between two or more trading parties. Derivatives can take many forms, from stock and bond derivatives to economic indicator derivatives.

Traders use derivatives to enter specific markets and trade different assets. Generally, derivatives are considered a form of advanced investment. The most common underlying assets for derivatives are stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indices. The contract value depends on changes in the price of the underlying asset (primary instrument).

Derivatives can be used to hedge positions, speculate on directional movements of underlying assets, or provide leverage for holdings. These assets are typically traded on exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) and are purchased through brokerage firms. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is one of the world's largest derivatives exchanges.[1]

It's important to remember that when companies hedge, they are not speculating on commodity prices. Instead, hedging is simply a way for each trading party to manage risk. Each trading party incorporates profit or profit margins into their prices, and hedging helps protect these profits from commodity price market fluctuations.

OTC derivatives typically have a greater possibility of counterparty risk, which is the danger that one party involved in the trade may default. These contracts are traded between two private parties and are unregulated. To hedge this risk, investors can purchase currency derivatives to lock in specific exchange rates. Derivatives available for hedging such risks include currency futures and currency swaps.

**Important Note:** Exchange-traded derivatives are more standardized and more strictly regulated than OTC derivatives.

## Special Considerations

Derivatives were originally used to ensure balanced exchange rates for international trade commodities. International traders needed a system to account for the different values of national currencies.

Suppose a European investor has all investment accounts denominated in euros (EUR). Suppose they purchase shares of a U.S. company through a U.S. exchange using U.S. dollars (USD). This means they are now exposed to exchange rate risk while holding the stock. Exchange rate risk is the threat that the euro will appreciate relative to the dollar. If this happens, any profits realized when selling the stock would be worth less when converted back to euros.

If a speculator expects the euro to appreciate against the dollar, they can profit by using a derivative that increases in value as the euro appreciates. When using derivatives to speculate on price movements of the underlying asset, the investor does not need to hold or have a position in the underlying asset.

**Note:** Many derivatives are leveraged, meaning that a small amount of money can control a large value stake in the underlying asset.

## Derivative Types

Today, derivatives are based on a wide variety of transactions and have more uses. There are even derivatives based on weather data, such as rainfall or number of sunny days in a particular region.

There are many different types of derivatives available for risk management, speculation, and leveraged positions. The derivatives market is a continuously growing market that offers products suitable for almost any need or risk tolerance.

Derivative products fall into two categories: "locks" and "options." Lock products (e.g., futures, forwards, or swaps) bind their respective parties from the start to the terms agreed upon for the duration of the contract. On the other hand, options products (e.g., stock options) give the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the underlying asset or security at a specific price on or before the option's expiration date. The most common types of derivatives are futures, forwards, swaps, and options.

A futures contract, or simply futures, is an agreement between two parties to buy and deliver an asset at an agreed price on a future date. Futures are standardized contracts traded on exchanges. Traders use futures contracts to hedge their risks or speculate on the price of the underlying asset. The parties are obligated to fulfill their promise to buy or sell the underlying asset.

For example, suppose Company A purchases an oil futures contract on November 6, 2021, at $62.22 per barrel, with the contract expiring on December 19, 2021. The company does this because it needs oil in December and is concerned about prices rising before they need to purchase. Buying the oil futures contract hedges the company's risk because the seller is obligated to deliver oil to Company A at $62.22 per barrel after the contract expires. Suppose by December 19, 2021, oil prices rise to $80 per barrel. Company A can accept delivery of the oil from the futures contract seller, but if it no longer needs the oil, it can also sell the contract before expiration and keep the profit.

In this example, both the futures buyer and seller hedged their risks. Company A needs oil in the future and wants to offset the risk of potentially higher prices in December by establishing a long position in oil futures contracts. The seller might be an oil company concerned about falling oil prices and wants to eliminate this risk by selling or shorting futures contracts that lock in the price they'll receive in December.

It's also possible that one or both parties are speculators with opposing views on oil's direction in December. In this case, one party might benefit from the contract while the other might not. For example, taking the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil futures contract traded on the CME, which represents 1,000 barrels of oil. If oil prices rise from $62.2 to $80 per barrel, then the trader holding a long position (buyer) in the futures contract will profit $17,780 [(80 - 62.2) x 1,000 = $17,780]. The trader holding a short position (seller) will lose $17,780.

Not all futures contracts are settled through delivery of the underlying asset at expiration. If both parties in the futures contract are speculative investors or traders, they're unlikely to arrange delivery of large amounts of crude oil. Speculators can end their obligation to buy or deliver the underlying commodity by closing (unwinding) their contract with an offsetting contract before expiration.

In fact, many derivatives are cash-settled, meaning the profits and losses in the trade are just accounting cash flows in the trader's brokerage account. Cash-settled futures contracts include many interest rate futures, stock index futures, and more unusual instruments like volatility futures or weather futures.

Forward contracts, or simply forwards, are similar to futures but they're not traded on exchanges. These contracts are only traded over-the-counter. When creating a forward contract, the buyer and seller can customize the terms, size, and settlement process. As an over-the-counter product, forward contracts carry greater counterparty risk for both parties.

Counterparty risk is a type of credit risk where parties may fail to fulfill the obligations outlined in the contract. If one party goes bankrupt, the other party may have no recourse and could lose the value of their position.

Once created, parties in a forward contract can offset their positions with other counterparties, which may increase the possibility of counterparty risk as more traders become involved in the same contract.

Swaps are another common type of derivative typically used to exchange one cash flow for another. For example, traders can use interest rate swaps to convert from a floating-rate loan to a fixed-rate loan, or vice versa.

Suppose XYZ Company borrows $1,000,000 and pays a floating rate loan currently at 6%. XYZ Company might be concerned about rising rates increasing the cost of this loan, or encounter a lender unwilling to extend more credit while the company carries this floating rate risk.

Suppose XYZ Company creates a swap with QRS Company, which is willing to exchange the floating rate loan payments for fixed rate loan payments at 7%. This means XYZ Company will pay QRS Company 7% on its $1,000,000 principal, while QRS Company will pay XYZ Company the 6% interest on the same principal. At the start of the swap, XYZ Company only needs to pay QRS Company the 1 percentage point difference between the two swap rates.

If rates fall, causing the original loan's floating rate to now be 5%, XYZ Company will have to pay QRS Company the 2 percentage point difference on the loan. If rates rise to 8%, then QRS Company will have to pay XYZ Company the 1 percentage point difference between the two swap rates. Regardless of how rates change, the swap accomplished XYZ Company's original goal of converting a floating rate loan to a fixed rate loan.

Swaps can also be structured to exchange currency exchange rate risk or loan default risk or cash flows from other business activities. Swaps related to cash flows and potential defaults with mortgage bonds were a very popular derivative. In fact, they were a bit too popular. It was the counterparty risk of these swaps that eventually evolved into the credit crisis of 2008.

Options contracts are similar to futures contracts in that they're also agreements between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a future date. The main difference between options and futures is that with options, the buyer has no obligation to exercise their buy or sell agreement. It's just an opportunity, not an obligation like futures. Like futures, options can be used to hedge or speculate on the price of the underlying asset.

**Note:** As for when you can exercise your rights to buy or sell, this depends on the option's "style." American options allow the holder to exercise the option rights at any time before (including) the expiration date. European options can only be exercised on the expiration date. Most stocks and ETFs have American options, while stock indices, including the S&P 500, have European options.

Suppose an investor owns 100 shares of stock worth $50 per share. They believe the stock will be worth more in the future. However, the investor is concerned about potential risk and decides to hedge their position using options. The investor can buy a put option that gives them the right to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock at $50 per share (called the strike price) until a specific date in the future (called the expiration date).

Suppose at expiration the stock is worth $40 per share, and the put option buyer decides to exercise the option and sell the stock at the original strike price of $50 per share. If buying the put option cost the investor $200, they would only lose the cost of the option since the strike price equals the price of the stock when they initially bought the put option. A strategy like this is called a protective put because it hedges the downside risk of the stock.

Alternatively, suppose an investor doesn't currently own the stock worth $50. They believe it will be worth more next month. The investor can buy a call option that gives them the right to buy the stock at $50 before or at expiration. Suppose this call option costs $200 and the stock rises to $60 before expiration. The buyer can now exercise their option and buy the stock worth $60 at the strike price of $50, resulting in an initial profit of $10 per share. The call option represents 100 shares of stock, so the actual profit is $1,000, minus the cost of the option (premium) and any brokerage commission fees.

In both examples, if the buyer chooses to exercise the contract, the seller is obligated to fulfill their contract. However, if the stock price is above the strike price at expiration, the put option will be worthless and the seller (option writer) can keep the premium as the option expires. If the stock price is below the strike price at expiration, the call option will be worthless and the call option seller will keep the premium.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Derivatives

As shown in the examples above, derivatives are useful tools for both businesses and investors. They provide a way to perform the following operations:

- Lock in prices
- Hedge against adverse interest rate movements
- Mitigate risks

These advantages are typically obtained at a limited cost.

Derivatives can usually also be purchased on margin, meaning traders use borrowed funds to buy them. This makes them more affordable.

Derivatives are difficult to value because they are based on the price of another asset. Risks of over-the-counter derivatives include counterparty risk that is difficult to predict or value. Most derivatives are also sensitive to:

- Changes in time to expiration
- Cost of holding the underlying asset
- Interest rates

These variables make it difficult to perfectly match the value of derivatives with the underlying asset.

Since derivatives have no intrinsic value (their value comes only from the underlying asset), they are susceptible to market sentiment and market risk. Supply and demand factors can cause derivatives' prices and liquidity to rise and fall regardless of how the underlying asset's price changes.

Finally, derivatives are typically leveraged instruments, and using leverage works both ways. While it can enhance returns, it can also make losses accumulate more quickly.

## What are Derivatives?

Derivatives are securities whose value depends on or derives from an underlying asset. For example, an oil futures contract is a derivative whose value is based on the market price of oil. Derivatives have become increasingly popular in recent decades, with the total value of outstanding derivatives estimated at $610 trillion as of June 30, 2021.[3]

## What are some examples of derivatives?

Common examples of derivatives include futures contracts, options contracts, and credit default swaps. Beyond these, there are numerous derivative contracts designed to meet the needs of various counterparties. In fact, since many derivatives are traded over-the-counter (OTC), they can theoretically be customized infinitely.

## What are the Main Benefits and Risks of Derivatives?

Derivatives can be a very convenient way to achieve financial objectives. For example, a company wanting to hedge its commodity exposure can do so by trading energy derivatives (such as crude oil futures). Similarly, a company can hedge its currency risk by purchasing currency forward contracts. Derivatives can also help investors leverage their positions, such as gaining exposure to stocks through stock options rather than buying the stocks directly. The main drawbacks of derivatives include counterparty risk, the inherent risks of leverage, and the fact that complex networks of derivative contracts can lead to systemic risk.
