## What is a Probability Distribution?

A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all possible values a random variable can take within a given range and their likelihood of occurrence. This range is bounded by minimum and maximum values. However, the specific position of possible values on the probability distribution depends on multiple factors, including the distribution's mean (average), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.

### Key Points

- Probability distributions depict the expected outcomes of possible results from a given data generation process.
- Probability distributions come in various shapes and characteristics.
- They are defined by mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
- Investors use probability distributions to predict asset returns (such as stocks) over time and hedge risks.

## How Probability Distributions Work

Perhaps the most common probability distribution is the normal distribution, also known as the bell curve, although many other distributions are widely used. The data generation process of certain phenomena typically determines their probability distribution. This process is known as the probability density function.

Probability distributions can also be used to generate cumulative distribution functions (CDF), which accumulate the probabilities of events occurring. They always start at zero and eventually reach 100%. [1]

Academics, financial analysts, and fund managers may evaluate the probability distribution of specific stocks to assess their expected future returns.

**Important Note:** Historical stock return data can be measured from any time period and may only capture a portion of stock returns. This makes the analysis susceptible to sampling error. Such error can be significantly reduced by increasing the sample size.

## Discrete Probability Distributions and Continuous Probability Distributions

Discrete probability distributions and continuous probability distributions are two fundamental types of probability distributions, each describing different types of random variables. Understanding the differences between them is crucial for correctly applying statistical methods and interpreting data.

Discrete probability distributions describe situations where the set of possible outcomes is countable and either finite or countably infinite. These distributions are used when random variables can take specific, distinct values.

For example, the number of heads in 10 coin flips or the number of customers arriving at a store in one hour are examples of discrete random variables. In these situations, you can list all possible outcomes, such as zero, one, two, and so on. The outcomes of discrete probability distributions tend to appear more "jumpy" due to fewer possible outcomes.

In contrast, continuous probability distributions apply to situations where random variables can take any value within a given range. These values are uncountable because there are infinitely many possibilities within any interval.

For example, the exact height of individuals in a population or the exact time needed to complete a task are continuous variables. The distribution curve of continuous probability distributions tends to appear smoother because there are more possible outcomes.

## Types of Probability Distributions

There are multiple categories of probability distributions. These include normal distribution, chi-square distribution, binomial distribution, and Poisson distribution. These probability distributions have different uses and represent different data generation processes. [1][2]

The binomial distribution evaluates the probability of an event occurring multiple times in a given number of trials, where this probability remains fixed for each trial. It can be generated by recording a basketball player's successful free throws in a game, where 1 represents a successful shot and 0 represents a miss.

Another example is using a coin to calculate the probability of getting heads in 10 consecutive flips. The binomial distribution is discrete because valid outcomes can only be 0 or 1. [3]

The most commonly used distribution is the normal distribution. It is frequently used in finance, investment, science, and engineering. The normal distribution is completely characterized by its mean and standard deviation. This distribution is not skewed and exhibits kurtosis.

This gives the distribution a symmetrical shape, appearing as a bell curve when plotted. The normal distribution has a mean (average) of zero, standard deviation of one, skewness of zero, and kurtosis = 3.

In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the data will fall within one standard deviation of the mean. About 95% of the data will fall within two standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% of the data will fall within three standard deviations of the mean. Unlike the binomial distribution, the normal distribution is continuous. All possible values are represented, not just 0 and 1 with nothing in between. [4]

**Note:** Probability refers to the likelihood of an event occurring, which is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. On the other hand, odds represent the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring. For example, if the probability of winning a game is 0.25, the odds are 1:3 (one win for every three losses).

## Law of Large Numbers

The Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of trials increases, the average of the results will tend toward the expected value or true probability. This principle ensures that as the number of observations increases, the sample mean converges to the population mean, thus providing stability for statistical inference.

## Validity of Probability Distributions

To determine whether a probability distribution is valid requires two steps. The first step is to analyze whether each probability is greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to one. The second step is to determine whether the sum of all probabilities equals one. If both the first and second steps are true, then the probability distribution is valid.

## Applications of Probability Distributions in Finance

Probability distributions have two main applications in finance:

## What are the Most Commonly Used Probability Distributions?

The most commonly used probability distributions include uniform distribution, binomial distribution, Bernoulli distribution, normal distribution, Poisson distribution, and exponential distribution.[6]

## What is the difference between probability and odds?

Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as the ratio of favorable outcomes to all possible outcomes. Odds, on the other hand, represent the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring. For example, if the probability of winning a game is 0.25, the odds are 1:3 (one win corresponds to three losses).

## Probability Distributions and the Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a statistical principle stating that the distribution of the sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables tends toward a normal distribution.

The significance of this theorem lies in its ability to allow statisticians to make inferences about population parameters even when the underlying population distribution is unknown, provided the sample size is sufficiently large.

A key implication of CLT is that for large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of sample means will approximately follow a normal distribution.

For example, imagine you have a class where students' heights vary, but the average height is about 5 feet with some variation. According to CLT, the distribution of sample means of heights will tend toward a normal (bell-shaped) curve.

## Examples of Probability Distributions

Consider the outcomes when rolling two standard six-sided dice. While the probability of rolling any number (1 to 6) on a single die is 1/6, the probability distribution of the sum of two dice is shown in the figure. 7 is the most common outcome (1+6, 6+1, 5+2, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3). The probabilities of rolling 2 and 12 are much lower (1+1 and 6+6 respectively).

## Conclusion

Probability distributions describe all possible values that a random variable can take. This has widespread applications in investing, particularly in evaluating potential stock performance and helping determine maximum losses in risk management.
