## What is the Coefficient of Variation (CV)?

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) is a statistical measure used to assess the dispersion of data points around the mean in a dataset. The CV represents the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, and it is a useful statistic for comparing the degree of variation between different datasets, even when their means differ significantly.

### Key Takeaways

- The Coefficient of Variation (CV) is a statistical measure used to assess the relative dispersion of data points around the mean in a dataset.
- It represents the ratio of standard deviation to the mean.
- CV can be used to compare variability between different datasets, even when their means are significantly different.
- In finance, the coefficient of variation allows investors to determine how much volatility or risk they are taking on relative to the expected returns of an investment.
- The lower the ratio of standard deviation to average returns, the better the risk-return trade-off.

## Understanding the Coefficient of Variation (CV)

The coefficient of variation shows the degree of variation in the data within a sample, relative to the overall mean.

In finance, the coefficient of variation allows investors to determine how much volatility or risk they are taking on compared to the expected returns of an investment. Ideally, if the coefficient of variation formula yields a lower ratio of standard deviation to average returns, the risk-return trade-off is better.[1]

They are most commonly used to analyze dispersion around the mean, but quartile, quintile, or decile CVs can also be used to understand variation around the median or, for example, the 10th percentile.

**Important Note:** The coefficient of variation formula or calculation can be used to determine the deviation between a stock, commodity, or bond's historical average price and current price performance relative to other assets.

## Coefficient of Variation (CV) Formula

Here is the formula for calculating the coefficient of variation:[2]

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{CV} = \frac { \sigma }{ \mu } \\ &\textbf{其中：} \\ &\sigma = \text{标准差} \\ &\mu = \text{均值} \\ \end{aligned} $$

To calculate the CV of a sample, the formula is:

$$ CV = s/x * 100 $$

**Note:** Multiplying the coefficient by 100 is an optional step to get a percentage rather than a decimal.

The coefficient of variation formula can be executed in Excel by first using the standard deviation function for the dataset. Next, calculate the mean using the provided Excel functions. Since the coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean, divide the cell containing the standard deviation by the cell containing the mean.

## Coefficient of Variation (CV) and Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is a statistical measure used to assess the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean. It is used to determine the distribution of values within a single dataset, rather than comparing different units.

When we want to compare two or more datasets, we use the coefficient of variation. CV is the ratio of standard deviation to mean. And because it is independent of the unit of measurement, it can be used to compare datasets with different units or those with large differences in means.

In simple terms, standard deviation measures the average distance from the mean, while the coefficient of variation measures the ratio of standard deviation to the mean.[2]

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Coefficient of Variation (CV)

The coefficient of variation can be useful when comparing datasets with different units or significantly different means.[3]

This includes when using risk/return ratios to select investments. For example, risk-averse investors may want to consider assets that have historically shown lower volatility relative to the overall market or their industry. Conversely, risk-seeking investors might look to invest in assets that have historically shown higher volatility.

When the mean is close to zero, CV is very sensitive to small changes in the mean. Using the example above, a notable drawback occurs when the expected return in the denominator is negative or zero. In such cases, the coefficient of variation can be misleading.[3]

If the expected return in the denominator of the coefficient of variation formula is negative or zero, the results can be misleading.[3]

## How to Use the Coefficient of Variation (CV)?

The coefficient of variation is used in many different fields, including chemistry, engineering, physics, economics, and neuroscience.

Beyond helping with investment selection using risk/return ratios, economists use it to measure economic inequality. Outside of finance, it is commonly used to audit the precision of specific processes and achieve perfect balance.

## Coefficient of Variation (CV) Example for Investment Selection

For example, consider a risk-averse investor who wishes to invest in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which are baskets of securities tracking broad market indices. The investor selects SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). The investor then analyzes the ETFs' returns and volatility over the past 15 years, assuming that ETF returns might be similar to their long-term averages.

For illustration purposes, the following 15-year historical information is used for the investor's decision:

- If SPDR S&P 500 ETF has an average annual return of 5.47% with a standard deviation of 14.68%, then SPY's coefficient of variation is 2.68.
- If Invesco QQQ ETF has an average annual return of 6.88% with a standard deviation of 21.31%, then QQQ's coefficient of variation is 3.10.
- If iShares Russell 2000 ETF has an average annual return of 7.16% with a standard deviation of 19.46%, then IWM's coefficient of variation is 2.72.

Based on these approximate figures, the investor could invest in either SPDR S&P 500 ETF or iShares Russell 2000 ETF, as their risk/return ratios are roughly the same and indicate a better risk-return trade-off than the Invesco QQQ ETF.

## What Does the Coefficient of Variation Tell Us?

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) represents the size of the standard deviation relative to its mean. The higher the coefficient of variation, the greater the degree of dispersion around the mean.[2]

## What is Considered a Good Coefficient of Variation?

This depends on what you are looking at and comparing. There is no set value that can be universally considered "good." However, generally speaking, a lower coefficient of variation is usually more desirable, as it indicates that the data values have a smaller spread relative to the mean.

## How to Calculate the Coefficient of Variation?

To calculate the coefficient of variation, first find the mean, then find the sum of squares, and then calculate the standard deviation. Once you have this information, you can calculate the coefficient of variation by dividing the standard deviation by the mean.[2]

## Bottom Line

The coefficient of variation is a simple method for comparing the degree of variation between different datasets. It can be applied to almost anything, including the process of selecting suitable investments.

Generally, a higher CV indicates greater variability within a group, while lower values indicate the opposite.
