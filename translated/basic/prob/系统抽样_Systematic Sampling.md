## What is Systematic Sampling?

Systematic sampling is a probability sampling method where sample members are selected from a larger population using a fixed periodic interval, starting from a random point. This sampling interval is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.

### Key Points

- Systematic sampling is a probability sampling method where random samples are selected from a larger population using fixed periodic intervals.
- This fixed periodic interval, known as the sampling interval, is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.
- Advantages of this method include elimination of cluster selection phenomena and low probability of data contamination.
- Disadvantages include over- or under-representation of specific patterns and greater risk of data manipulation.
- There are three main types of systematic sampling: random systematic sampling, linear systematic sampling, and circular systematic sampling.

## Understanding Systematic Sampling

When properly executed on a defined large population, systematic sampling can help researchers (including marketing and sales professionals) obtain representative findings about large groups without having to contact every individual.

Since simple random sampling of a population can be inefficient and time-consuming, statisticians turn to other methods such as systematic sampling. Sample size selection can be completed quickly using a systematic approach. Once a fixed starting point is determined, a constant interval is chosen to facilitate the selection of participants.

Systematic sampling is preferable to simple random sampling when the risk of data manipulation is low. If there is a high risk that researchers can manipulate the interval length to obtain desired results, then simple random sampling techniques would be more appropriate.

Systematic sampling is popular among researchers and analysts due to its simplicity. Researchers typically assume the results represent the majority of normal populations unless random characteristics are disproportionately present in every nth data sample (which is unlikely). In other words, the population needs to exhibit a certain degree of natural randomness along with the selected indicators. If the population has some standardized pattern, the risk of accidentally selecting very common cases becomes more apparent.

In systematic sampling, as with other sampling methods, the target population must be selected before choosing participants. The population can be identified based on any number of desired characteristics that suit the purpose of the study being conducted. Some selection criteria may include age, gender, race, location, education level, or occupation.

**Important Note:** There are several methods of sampling a population for statistical inference. Systematic sampling is a form of random sampling.

## When to Use Systematic Sampling

Systematic sampling is most suitable in situations where the studied population exhibits a certain degree of order or regularity. For example, if you are surveying customers entering a store, systematic sampling allows you to systematically select every nth customer, ensuring representation across different times of day or week. This method helps avoid bias that might arise from only selecting customers who arrive during specific time periods.

Another situation where systematic sampling is applicable is when the population size is known and relatively large. Systematic sampling simplifies the process by eliminating the need to list and randomly select individuals from the entire population, instead selecting samples at a set rhythm. This is particularly useful in large-scale studies with limited time and resources, meaning you don't need to spend extensive effort planning the sample.

Systematic sampling can be used when researchers want to ensure the sample is evenly distributed throughout the entire population. For example, a company might select every nth person from a company directory filtered by surname. Other forms of sampling might accidentally cluster similar groups together (i.e., selecting too many people from the finance department, depending on how the sample aggregates).

Furthermore, systematic sampling has the advantage of being simple to implement compared to other sampling methods. It requires minimal calculations and can be easily executed using simple algorithms, especially when both the target sample size and total population size are known.

## Steps to Create System Samples

You can use the following steps to create system samples:1

## Systematic Sampling Examples

As a hypothetical example of systematic sampling, suppose in a population of 10,000 people, a statistician chooses to sample every 100th person. The sampling interval can also be systematic in terms of time, such as selecting new samples every 12 hours.

As another example, if you want to use systematic sampling to select a random group of 1,000 people from a population of 50,000, you must put all potential participants on a list and select a starting point. Once the list is formed, every 50th person on the list (counting from the selected starting point) will be chosen as a participant, because 50,000 รท 1,000 = 50.

For instance, if the selected starting point is 20, then the 60th person on the list would be selected, followed by the 120th person, and so on. Once the end of the list is reached and additional participants are needed, the count cycles back to the beginning of the list to complete the count.

**Note:** To conduct systematic sampling, researchers must first know the size of the target population.

## Types of Systematic Sampling

Generally, there are three methods for generating systematic samples:

This is the classic form of systematic sampling, where subjects are selected at predetermined intervals. For example, if researchers want to select a sample of 100 students from a population of 1,000 students, they can use systematic random sampling by selecting every 10th student from a randomly ordered list. This method ensures that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected while still maintaining the systematic sampling pattern.

Unlike random selection sampling intervals, this refers to creating skip patterns along a linear path. This means that instead of selecting every nth member from the population, the selection process follows a predetermined sequence, such as selecting every 5th member, then every 7th member, then every 9th member, and so on. Linear systematic sampling can be useful in cases where there is a specific order or sequence along a linear path, such as geographical locations along a linear route.

This refers to samples that start again from the same point after ending. This means that once the sampling interval reaches the last member of the population, it wraps around to the beginning and continues the selection process. Circular systematic sampling is typically used in situations where the population exhibits cyclical patterns or has no clear beginning or end. For example, if researchers are studying tree growth in a forest, they might use circular systematic sampling by selecting trees at regular intervals along a circular path, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the forest area.

## Systematic Sampling and Cluster Sampling

Systematic sampling and cluster sampling differ in how they extract sample points from the population they contain. Cluster sampling breaks down the population into clusters, while systematic sampling uses fixed intervals from a larger population to create samples.

Systematic sampling selects a random starting point from the population and then draws samples from regular fixed intervals based on the population size. Cluster sampling divides the population into clusters and then draws a simple random sample from each cluster.

Cluster sampling is considered less precise than other sampling methods. However, it can save costs in obtaining samples. Cluster sampling is a two-step sampling procedure. It can be used when completing a list of the entire population is difficult. For example, it's challenging to construct the entire population of grocery store customers for interviews.

However, one can create a random subset of stores, which is the first step of the process. The second step is to interview a random sample of customers from these stores. This is a simple manual process that can save time and money.

## Common Errors to Avoid in Systematic Sampling

When using systematic sampling, a common pitfall is selecting an inappropriate sampling interval. Choosing too small an interval can lead to oversampling and increased sampling error, while choosing too large an interval can result in undersampling and reduced sample representativeness. This error can be avoided by thoroughly understanding the full range of the population before beginning the sampling process.

Another error to avoid is failing to consider potential biases that may be introduced by the sampling frame. If the sampling frame does not represent the population of interest, systematic sampling may lead to biased results. For example, if the sampling frame only includes individuals from certain demographic groups or geographic locations, the sample will not reflect the diversity of the entire population. This type of error is present in all forms of sampling.

Another important consideration is whether systematic patterns or cycles exist within the population. If periodic patterns or trends in the population align with the sampling interval, certain parts of the population may be systematically over- or under-represented. For example, imagine selecting random players from a baseball roster. If these rosters are listed in order by position, you might end up selecting players from the same position across different teams because the population has a cyclical pattern.

## Limitations of Systematic Sampling

One risk that statisticians must consider when conducting systematic sampling relates to how the list used with the sampling interval is organized. If the population placed on the list is organized in a cyclical pattern that matches the sampling interval, the selected sample may be biased.

For example, a company's HR department wants to select a sample of employees and ask them about their views on company policies. The employees are divided into teams of 20, each led by a manager. If the list used for selecting the sample size is organized with teams clustered together, the statistician risks selecting only managers (or no managers at all), depending on the sampling interval.

## How to Perform Systematic Sampling?

To conduct systematic sampling, first determine the total population size from which you want to sample. Then, select a random starting point and choose every nth member from the population based on a predetermined sampling interval.

## When should I use systematic sampling?

You should use systematic sampling when you need a simple and effective method to select representative samples from a large population with a known and uniform distribution structure, and when randomization is either impractical or unnecessary for your research objectives.

## What are the advantages of systematic sampling?

Systematic sampling is easy to conduct and easy to understand, which is why it is often favored by researchers. The central assumption that results represent the majority of the normal population ensures uniform sampling across the entire population.

Furthermore, due to its process, systematic sampling provides a higher degree of control compared to other sampling methods. Systematic sampling also has lower risk factors because there is little chance of data contamination.

## What are the disadvantages of systematic sampling?

The main disadvantage of systematic sampling is that it requires knowledge of the total population size. If the specific number of participants in the population is unknown, systematic sampling cannot function effectively. For example, if a statistician wants to examine the ages of homeless people in a specific area but cannot accurately determine how many homeless people there are, they will have neither a population size nor a starting point. Another disadvantage is that the population needs to exhibit a certain degree of natural randomness; otherwise, there is an increased risk of selecting similar instances, which defeats the purpose of sampling.

## What are the differences between cluster sampling and systematic sampling?

Cluster sampling and systematic sampling differ in how sample points are drawn from the population included in the sample. Cluster sampling divides the population into clusters, then draws a simple random sample from each cluster. Systematic sampling selects a random starting point from the population, then draws samples at regular fixed intervals based on the population size. Cluster sampling is more prone to larger sampling errors than systematic sampling, although it may be a less expensive process.

## Bottom Line

Sampling can be an effective method for drawing conclusions about a large group of people, items, or other items of interest. Systematic sampling is one of the most popular methods to achieve this as it is cheaper and more time-efficient than other options. Yes, it's not perfect. However, if you have a large dataset and there are no patterns between intervals, systematic sampling can provide reliable samples at a relatively low cost.
