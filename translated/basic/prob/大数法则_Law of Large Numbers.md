## What is the Law of Large Numbers?

The Law of Large Numbers applies to probability and statistics. It states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean will increasingly approach the population mean, as larger samples are more representative of the entire population.

In a financial context, the Law of Large Numbers suggests that rapidly growing large entities cannot maintain such growth rates indefinitely. Blue-chip stocks with market capitalizations in the hundreds of billions are often cited as classic examples of this phenomenon.

### Key Points

- The Law of Large Numbers states that the observed average of a large sample will approach the true population mean, and this approximation becomes stronger as the sample size increases.
- The Law of Large Numbers does not guarantee that any particular sample will reflect the true population characteristics, especially when the sample is small.
- It also does not guarantee that a sample that doesn't reflect the true population will be balanced out by a subsequent sample.
- The Law of Large Numbers indicates that larger samples will better represent the population average. The Central Tendency Theorem shows that larger samples will represent the population distribution.
- The term "Law of Large Numbers" is sometimes used differently in business contexts to express the relationship between scale and growth rates.

## Understanding the Law of Large Numbers

The Law of Large Numbers can be understood from two perspectives.

In statistical analysis, the Law of Large Numbers can be applied to various topics. While it may not be practical to survey every individual in a specific population to collect the required data volume, each additional data point potentially increases the probability that the result is a true measurement of the mean.

The Law of Large Numbers does not imply that a given sample or series of consecutive samples will always reflect the true population characteristics, especially when the sample or sample series deviates from the true population mean. It also does not guarantee that consecutive samples will push the observed average toward the population mean, as suggested by the Gambler's Fallacy.

The term "Law of Large Numbers" is sometimes used in business in relation to growth rates. Expressed as a percentage, it suggests that maintaining growth rates becomes increasingly difficult as a business expands. Even if the percentage growth rate remains constant, the underlying dollar amount continues to increase.

**Important Note:** The Law of Large Numbers should not be confused with the Law of Averages, which states that the distribution of outcomes in large or small samples reflects the distribution of outcomes in the population.

## Statistical Analysis Example of the Law of Large Numbers

If you want to determine the average of a dataset consisting of 100 possible values, choosing 20 data points rather than relying on just two data points is more likely to yield an accurate average. Two data points are much more likely to be outliers or unrepresentative, while the probability of all 20 data points being unrepresentative is much lower.

If your dataset contains all integers from 1 to 100, and you only sample two values of 95 and 40, your average might be determined to be approximately 67.5. If you continue random sampling up to 20 variables, as more data points are considered, the average should gradually converge toward the true mean.

## Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem

The Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem are related in statistical analysis. The Central Limit Theorem shows that sample means will be uniformly distributed as the sample size increases. This typically appears as a bell-shaped curve, where the peak of the curve is the mean, and the sample data is uniformly distributed on both sides of the curve.

The Law of Large Numbers also indicates that as the sample size grows, the data becomes more precise, and the Law of Large Numbers moves closer to the center of the bell curve. It states that the sample mean will more closely approximate the population mean as the sample size increases. Therefore, the Law of Large Numbers relates to the peak or mean of the curve, while the Central Limit Theorem relates to the distribution of the curve.

## Law of Large Numbers and Business Growth

The term "Law of Large Numbers" is sometimes colloquially used in business and finance to describe the phenomenon where exponential growth rates become difficult to maintain as scale increases. This is unrelated to the actual Law of Large Numbers, but may be a result of the law of diminishing marginal returns or diseconomies of scale.

The same principle applies to other metrics such as market capitalization or net profit. Investment decisions can be guided by the corresponding difficulties that companies with very high market values experience in terms of stock appreciation. This concept is quite central to the growth versus value stock discussion, as companies may leverage this point in their business strategy to maintain rapid growth after market success.

## Business Examples of the Law of Large Numbers

Tesla reported automotive sales of $24.604 billion in fiscal year 2020, which increased to $44.125 billion the following year, representing growth of approximately 79%. "[1] The electric vehicle market is emerging, and Tesla is beginning to experience economies of scale, achieving rapid success.

The Law of Large Numbers suggests that as Tesla continues to grow, maintaining such production levels will become increasingly difficult. Clearly, under the assumption of consistent growth rates over several years, Tesla cannot maintain its current growth trajectory, as the underlying dollar values become unreasonable.

## Law of Large Numbers and Insurance

The Law of Large Numbers is equally significant in the insurance industry. It is used to calculate and refine expected risks.

Imagine a scenario where an insurance company assesses how much to charge customers for auto insurance. If the dataset is small, the company cannot adequately determine the appropriate risk profile.

As the amount of collected data increases, the company experiences the Law of Large Numbers. It may quickly discover that young male drivers are most likely to have accidents. This larger sample better represents the occurrence of driving incidents, allowing the insurance company to make more accurate insurance premium judgments.

The Law of Large Numbers also enables insurance companies to refine their premium assessment criteria by analyzing which characteristics lead to higher risks.

## Why is the Law of Large Numbers Important?

The Law of Large Numbers is important in statistical analysis because it provides validity to sample sizes. When you analyze with small amounts of data, your assumptions may not properly translate to the actual population, so it's important to ensure you capture enough data points to appropriately represent the entire dataset.

The Law of Large Numbers is also important when setting company targets. A company might double its revenue in one year. If it then achieves only 50% revenue growth in the following year, it will have earned the same amount of money over the past two years. Percentages can be misleading because large dollar values surge.

## How Do Companies Overcome the Challenge of the Law of Large Numbers?

Companies typically overcome the challenge of the Law of Large Numbers by acquiring smaller growth companies that can achieve scalable growth. They also try to improve efficiency and leverage their scale advantages in manufacturing, ordering, or distribution. Companies can focus more on dollar targets rather than percentage targets.

## What is the Law of Small Numbers?

The Law of Small Numbers refers to people's tendency to underestimate the variability in small samples. When the sample size is too small, they often overestimate population values based on incorrect sample sizes.

## What is the Law of Small Numbers in Psychology?

In psychology, the Law of Large Numbers is reflected in how a greater number of trials typically leads to more accurate expected values. As the number of trials increases, predictions become closer to correct medical assessments.

## Summary

When analyzing datasets, ensure you understand the Law of Large Numbers to determine if your sample size can represent the entire population. However, when analyzing companies, pay attention to the scale of the sample. The Law of Large Numbers indicates that as a company's size increases, maintaining percentage growth becomes increasingly difficult because the underlying absolute changes required continue to grow larger.
