## What is a Z-Score?

A Z-score is a statistical measurement that describes the relationship between a value and the mean of a set of values. Z-scores are measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. In investing and trading, Z-scores serve as indicators of instrument volatility, which traders can use to help determine volatility.

### Key Takeaways

- A Z-score is a statistical measurement of how a score relates to the mean in a group of scores.
- Z-scores can reveal to traders whether a value is typical or atypical for a specified dataset.
- Generally, Z-scores between -3.0 and 3.0 indicate that a stock is trading within three standard deviations of its mean.
- Traders have developed numerous methods using Z-scores to identify trades, correlations between trading positions, and evaluate trading strategies.

## Understanding Z-Scores

A Z-score is a statistical measure that quantifies the distance between a data point and the mean of a dataset. It is expressed in terms of standard deviations. It indicates how many standard deviations a data point is from the distribution's mean.

If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score. A Z-score of 1.0 means the value is one standard deviation away from the mean. Z-scores can be positive or negative, with positive values indicating scores above the mean and negative values indicating scores below the mean.

Z-scores are sometimes confused with Altman Z-scores, which are calculated using factors from company financial reports. While Altman Z-scores are used to calculate the probability of a company going bankrupt within two years, Z-scores can be used to determine how much a stock's returns deviate from its average returns—and much more.

**Note:** Z-scores are also known as standard scores.

## Z-Score Formula

The statistical formula for calculating the Z-score of a value uses the following formula:

Where:

- z = Z-score
- x = Value being evaluated
- μ = Mean
- σ = Standard deviation

## How to Calculate Z-Scores

To calculate a Z-score, you first need to determine the mean and standard deviation of your data. Once you have these numbers, you can calculate the Z-score. Thus, assume you have the following variables:

- x = 57
- μ = 52
- σ = 4

You will use these variables in the formula:

- z = ( 57 - 52 ) / 4
- z = 1.25

Therefore, your chosen value's Z-score indicates it is 1.25 standard deviations away from the mean.

To determine Z-scores using a spreadsheet, you need to input your values and determine the mean and standard deviation of the range. Use the following formula:

You will find the mean of the following values is 12.17, with a standard deviation of 6.4.

||A|B|C
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Factor (x)|Mean (μ)|Standard Deviation (σ)
|2|3|12.17|6.4
|3|13|12.17|6.4
|4|8|12.17|6.4
|5|21|12.17|6.4
|6|17|12.17|6.4
|7|11|12.17|6.4

Using the Z-score formula, you can calculate the Z-score for each factor. Use the following formula in D2, then D3, and so on:

||A|B|C|D
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Factor (x)|Mean (μ)|Standard Deviation (σ)|Z-Score
|2|3|12.17|6.4|-1.43
|3|13|12.17|6.4|0.13
|4|8|12.17|6.4|-0.65
|5|21|12.17|6.4|1.38
|6|17|12.17|6.4|0.75
|7|11|12.17|6.4|-0.18

## How to Use Z-Score

In its most basic form, the Z-score allows you to determine how far the returns of the stock you're evaluating deviate from the mean of a stock sample (measured in standard deviations). The average score you have can be the average of annual stock returns, the average return of its listed index, or the average return of your chosen stock selection.

Some traders use Z-scores in more advanced evaluation methods, such as weighting stock returns to use factor investing, where Z-scores and standard deviations are used to evaluate stocks based on specific attributes. In the forex market, traders use Z-scores and confidence limits to test a trading system's ability to generate sequences of profits and losses.

## Z-Score and Standard Deviation

In most large datasets (assuming normal distribution), 99.7% of values fall between -3 and 3 standard deviations, 95% fall between -2 and 2 standard deviations, and 68% fall between -1 and 1 standard deviation.

Standard deviation represents the amount of variation (or dispersion) within a given dataset. For example, if a normally distributed data sample has a standard deviation of 3.1, and another sample has a standard deviation of 6.3, the model with SD of 6.3 is more dispersed and plots with a lower peak than the sample with SD of 3.1.

Distribution curves have negative and positive sides, hence there are both negative and positive standard deviations and Z-scores. However, this has nothing to do with the value itself other than indicating which side of the mean it falls on. Negative values indicate it falls on the left side of the mean, while positive values indicate it falls on the right side.

Z-score shows how many standard deviations a given data point differs from the mean. Therefore, the standard deviation must be calculated first, as the Z-score uses it to convey the variability of data points.

## What is a Z-Score?

A Z-score is a method of determining the distance between a data point and the population mean, measured in standard deviations. It tells us whether a data point is typical or unusual compared to the rest of the population, which is useful for identifying unusual values and comparing data across different groups.

## How to Calculate Z-Score?

The Z-score is calculated by finding the difference between a data point and the mean of the dataset, then dividing this difference by the standard deviation, to determine how many standard deviations the data point is away from the mean.

## How is Z-Score Used in Real Life?

Z-scores are used in many real-life applications, such as medical assessments, test scoring, business decisions, and evaluating investment and trading opportunities. Traders who use statistical metrics like Z-scores to evaluate trading opportunities are called quantitative traders.

## What is a Good Z-Score?

The higher (or lower) the Z-score, the further that point is from the mean. This isn't necessarily good or bad; it simply shows where the data falls within a normal distribution sample. This means when evaluating investments or opportunities, it depends on preferences. For example, some investors use a Z-score range of -3.0 to 3.0 because 99.7% of normally distributed data falls within this range, while others might use -1.5 to 1.5 because they prefer scores closer to the mean.

## Why is the Z-score so important?

The Z-score is important because it tells you where data sits within a data distribution. For example, if a Z-score is 1.5, it means it's 1.5 standard deviations away from the mean. Since 68% of data falls within one standard deviation (if it's normally distributed), 1.5 might be considered too far from the mean to make you comfortable.

## Bottom Line

Z-score is a statistical measurement that tells you how far your data is from the mean (or average) in a normally distributed sample. At its most basic level, investors and traders use quantitative analysis methods like Z-scores to determine how a stock is performing compared to other stocks or its own historical performance. In more advanced Z-score applications, traders weigh investments against ideal standards, develop other indicators, and even attempt to predict trading strategy outcomes.
