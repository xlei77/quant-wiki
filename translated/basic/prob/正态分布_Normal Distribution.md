## What is Normal Distribution?

Normal distribution, also known as Gaussian distribution, is a symmetric probability distribution around the mean, indicating that data points closer to the mean occur more frequently than those farther from the mean. When plotted, the normal distribution appears as a "bell-shaped curve."

### Key Points

- Normal distribution is the formal term for the probability bell curve.
- In a normal distribution, the mean is zero, standard deviation is 1, skewness is zero, and kurtosis is 3.
- Normal distribution is symmetric, but not all symmetric distributions are normal.

## Properties of Normal Distribution

The normal distribution is the most commonly assumed distribution type in technical stock market analysis. The standard normal distribution has two parameters: mean and standard deviation. In a normal distribution, the mean (average), median (midpoint), and mode (most frequent observation) are equal. These values represent the peak of the distribution, which decreases symmetrically around the mean, with its width defined by the standard deviation.

The normal distribution model is key to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which states that means calculated from independent and identically distributed random variables approximate a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution type of these variables.

The normal distribution is a symmetric distribution. Symmetric distributions occur when a dividing line produces two mirror images. Not all symmetric distributions are normal, as some data may present two peaks or a series of hills, rather than just the bell curve that represents the normal distribution.

## Observations

For all normal distributions, 68.2% of observations will fall within one standard deviation of the mean; 95.4% will fall within two standard deviations; and 99.7% will fall within three standard deviations.

This fact is sometimes called the "empirical rule" and serves as a heuristic method for describing where most data appears in a normal distribution. Data falling outside three standard deviations ("3-sigma") is considered a rare event.

Skewness measures the symmetry of a distribution. The normal distribution is symmetric with a skewness of zero. If a dataset's distribution has skewness less than zero, known as negative skewness (left-skewed), the left tail is longer than the right tail; positive skewness (right-skewed) means the right tail is longer than the left tail.

Kurtosis measures the thickness of a distribution's tails. The normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3.0. Distributions with kurtosis greater than 3.0 exhibit tail data that extends beyond the tails of a normal distribution (for example, five or more standard deviations from the mean).

This excess kurtosis is known in statistics as leptokurtic, but more commonly referred to as "fat-tailed." The fat-tail phenomenon in financial markets describes what is known as tail risk. Distributions with kurtosis less than 3.0 (platykurtic) typically exhibit tails that are less extreme than those of the normal distribution ("thinner").

## Formula

The normal distribution follows the following formula. Note that only the values of mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) are needed.

Where:

- x = The variable or data value being examined, f(x) is the probability function.
- μ = Mean
- σ = Standard deviation

## Applications of Normal Distribution in Finance

The normal distribution assumption is applied to asset prices and price behavior. Traders may plot price points to fit recent price behavior to a normal distribution. In such cases, the further the price behavior deviates from the mean, the higher the probability that the asset is overvalued or undervalued. Traders can use standard deviations to suggest potential trades. This type of trading is typically conducted within very short time frames, as longer time periods make it more difficult to select entry and exit points.

Similarly, many statistical theories attempt to model asset prices and assume these prices follow a normal distribution. In reality, price distributions tend to exhibit fat tails, resulting in kurtosis typically greater than three. These assets experience price fluctuations exceeding three standard deviations from the mean much more frequently than would be expected under a normal distribution assumption. Even if an asset follows a normal distribution for a period of time, there is no guarantee that past performance truly reflects future behavior.

## Examples of Normal Distribution

Many natural phenomena appear to follow a normal distribution. For example, the average human height is approximately 175 centimeters (5 feet 9 inches), including both males and females.

As shown in the graph below, most people conform to this average. Taller and shorter individuals appear with gradually decreasing frequency in the population. According to the empirical rule, 99.7% of people fall within three standard deviations of the mean, which is between 154 centimeters (5 feet 0 inches) and 196 centimeters (6 feet 5 inches). People above or below this range are rare (each accounting for 0.15% of the total population).

## What is Normal Distribution?

A normal distribution describes a symmetrical data plot around the mean value, where the width of the curve is defined by the standard deviation. Visually, it appears as a "bell-shaped curve."

## Why is the Normal Distribution Called "Normal"?

The normal distribution is technically known as the Gaussian distribution, but it was termed "normal" in 19th-century scientific publications, showing that many natural phenomena appeared to "normally deviate" from their mean. This concept of "normal variation" was introduced by naturalist Sir Francis Galton in his 1889 publication "Natural Inheritance."

## What are the limitations of normal distribution in finance?

Although normal distribution is a statistical concept, its application in finance may be limited because financial phenomena—such as expected stock market returns—do not perfectly follow a normal distribution. Prices tend to exhibit log-normal distribution, which is right-skewed and has fatter tails. Therefore, over-reliance on the bell curve when making predictions may lead to unreliable results. While most analysts are aware of this limitation, overcoming this deficiency is relatively difficult because it's often unclear which statistical distribution should be chosen as an alternative.

## Conclusion

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that forms a "bell-shaped curve" when plotted. The normal distribution describes a symmetrical data pattern around the mean value, where the width of the curve is defined by the standard deviation.
