## What is Joint Probability?

Joint probability is a statistical measure that calculates the likelihood of two events occurring simultaneously. Simply put, joint probability is the probability that event Y occurs when event X occurs. For joint probability to hold, the two events must be independent, meaning there should be no conditional relationship or interdependence between them. Joint probability can be visualized using a Venn diagram.

### Key Points

- Joint probability is a statistical measure used to calculate the likelihood of two events occurring simultaneously.
- The two events must be mutually independent.
- Joint probability is also known as the intersection of two or more events.
- It differs from conditional probability, which refers to the probability of one event occurring given that another event has occurred.
- Venn diagrams can be used to visualize joint probability.

## Joint Probability Formulas and Calculations

There are several different forms for expressing joint probability. The following formula represents the probability of the intersection of events:

$$ \begin{aligned} & P\ \left ( X\bigcap Y \right ) \\ &\textbf{其中:}\\ &X, Y = \text{两个不同的交集事件}\\ &P(X \text{ 和 } Y), P(XY) = \text{事件X和Y的联合概率}\\ \end{aligned} $$

**Note:** Although joint probability can help you determine the likelihood of two different events occurring simultaneously, it does not indicate how these two events influence each other.

## What Can Joint Probability Tell You?

Probability is a field closely related to statistics that deals with the likelihood of events or phenomena occurring. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents an impossible event and 1 represents a certain outcome.

For example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck is 1/2 = 0.5. This means there is an equal chance of drawing a red or black card since there are 26 cards of each color. Therefore, the probability of drawing a red card versus a black card is 50-50.

Joint probability measures two events occurring simultaneously. Joint probability can only be applied when multiple observations can occur at the same time. Thus, the joint probability of drawing a card that is both red and a 6 from a deck is P(6 ∩ red) = 2/52 = 1/26, because there are two red 6s in a deck—the 6 of hearts and 6 of diamonds. Since the events red and 6 are independent, you can also calculate the joint probability using the formula:

$$ P(6 \cap red) = P(6) \times P(red) = 4/52 \times 26/52 = 1/26 $$

In joint probability, the symbol "∩" is called the intersection. The probability of events X and Y occurring simultaneously is the same as the point where X and Y intersect. Therefore, joint probability is also known as the intersection of two or more events. A Venn diagram is one of the best visualization tools to explain intersection:

From the Venn diagram above, you can see that the overlapping point of the two circles is the intersection, which contains two observations: the 6 of hearts and 6 of diamonds.

## Joint Probability and Conditional Probability

Joint probability should not be confused with conditional probability, which refers to the probability of one event occurring given that another event has occurred. The formula for conditional probability is:

$$ P(X, 给定~Y) \text{ 或 } P(X | Y) $$

This means that the chance of one event occurring depends on another event. For example, from a deck of cards, given that you drew a red card, the probability of drawing a 6 is P(6|red) = 2/26 = 1/13, because there are two 6s among the 26 red cards.

Joint probability only considers the possibility of two events occurring simultaneously. Conditional probability can be used to calculate joint probability, as shown in the following formula:

$$ P(X \cap Y) = P(X|Y) \times P(Y) $$

The probability of events A and B occurring is the probability of event X occurring given that event Y has occurred, multiplied by the probability of event Y occurring. According to this formula, the probability of drawing both a 6 and a red card is:

$$ \begin{aligned} &P(6 \cap red) = P(6|red) \times P(red) = \\ &1/13 \times 26/52 = 1/13 \times 1/2 = 1/26\\ \end{aligned} $$

Statisticians and analysts use joint probability as a tool for measuring the likelihood of two or more observable events occurring simultaneously. For example, joint probability can be used to estimate the likelihood that Microsoft's stock price will fall when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) falls, or the chance that oil prices will rise when the US dollar depreciates.

**Important Note:** Joint probability depends on two events occurring independently. To determine if they are truly independent, it's important to understand whether the outcome of one event affects the other. If they influence each other, they are dependent, which leads to conditional probability. If there is no mutual influence, then what you have is joint probability.

## Example of Joint Probability

Let's use another example to illustrate how joint probability works. This example uses dice, where we want to calculate the probability of rolling two fours. Remember that each die has six faces.

To determine the joint probability, we first need to identify the probability of each die roll:

- The probability of rolling a four on the first die is 1/6
- The probability of rolling a four on the second die is 1/6

Now we can use the joint probability formula mentioned above by multiplying each individual event to calculate the joint probability of this event.

1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36

This means the probability of rolling two fours with a pair of dice is 1/36.

## What Can Joint Probability Tell You?

Joint probability is a statistical measure that tells you the likelihood of two events occurring simultaneously. You can use it to determine.

## What are the conditions for joint probability?

For joint probability to occur, certain conditions must be met. The first condition is that both events must occur simultaneously. Another condition is that the two events must be independent of each other. Therefore, the outcomes cannot influence each other.

## Can Joint Probability Exceed 1?

No, joint probability will never exceed 1. Joint probability values range between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates the impossibility of two events occurring simultaneously, and 1 indicates a certain outcome.

## Summary

Probability refers to the likelihood of an event occurring. However, when dealing with two variables, you may encounter joint probability. This is a statistical measure that tells you whether two independent events are likely to occur simultaneously. For statisticians, this is an important indicator used to determine the relationship between two sets of variables, such as the relationship between women and sports. However, it does not indicate how these two variables influence each other.
