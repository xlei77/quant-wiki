## What is Statistical Significance?

Statistical significance is a judgment made by analysts that data results are not merely due to chance factors. Statistical hypothesis testing is the method analysts use to make this judgment. The test provides a p-value, which is the probability of observing results as extreme as the data results, assuming they were indeed caused by chance factors.

Typically, a p-value of 5% or lower is considered statistically significant.

### Key Points

- Statistical significance determines whether the relationship between two or more variables is caused by non-random factors.
- It is used to provide evidence for evaluating the credibility of the null hypothesis, which assumes that variations in the data are caused only by random factors.
- Statistical hypothesis testing is used to determine whether the results of a dataset are statistically significant.
- A p-value of 5% or lower is typically considered statistically significant.

## Understanding Statistical Significance

Statistical significance is a judgment about the null hypothesis, which assumes that results are caused only by random factors. When the p-value is sufficiently small, the dataset is considered statistically significant.

When the p-value is large, the results can be explained by chance factors, and the data is considered consistent with the null hypothesis, although this does not prove that the null hypothesis is correct.

When the p-value is sufficiently small, typically 5% or lower, the results are not easily explained by chance factors, and the data is considered inconsistent with the null hypothesis. In such cases, the null hypothesis is rejected, typically supporting a more systematic explanation.[1]

**Important Note:** Statistical significance is commonly used in testing the effectiveness of new drugs, vaccines, and pathological studies. This can provide investors with reference points regarding the success rates of a company's new product launches.

## Examples of Statistical Significance

Suppose financial analyst Alex is investigating whether some investors had advance knowledge of a company's sudden bankruptcy. Alex decides to compare the daily market returns before and after the bankruptcy to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between these two means.

The study's p-value is 28% (>5%), indicating that differences like those observed (-0.0033 to +0.0007) are not uncommon when explained by chance factors alone. Therefore, the data does not provide strong evidence that anyone had advance knowledge of the company's bankruptcy.

If the p-value were 0.01%, far below 5%, the observed difference would be highly unusual when explained by chance factors alone. In this case, Alex might decide to reject the null hypothesis and further investigate whether traders had advance information.

Statistical significance is also used to test new medical products, including drugs, devices, and vaccines. Publicly released statistical significance reports also provide investors with information about the success rates of companies' new product launches.

Suppose a leading diabetes drug company reports that its new insulin shows statistically significant reduction in diabetes during testing. The test ran for 26 weeks with randomized treatment among diabetes patients, showing a p-value of 4%. This indicates to investors and regulators that the data indeed shows a statistically significant reduction in diabetes. [2]

Pharmaceutical company stock prices are often affected by announcements of statistical significance for their new products. [3]

## Methods for Determining Statistical Significance

Statistical hypothesis testing is used to determine whether data is statistically significant and whether a phenomenon can be explained as a purely random byproduct. Statistical significance is a judgment of the null hypothesis, which assumes that results exist solely due to random factors. Rejecting the null hypothesis is a necessary condition for data to be considered statistically significant.

## What is p-value?

A p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference is caused by random factors alone. When the p-value is sufficiently small (5% or lower), the result is unlikely to be explained by chance, and the null hypothesis can be rejected. When the p-value is large, the data can be considered consistent with the null hypothesis, thus supporting its validity.

## Uses of Statistical Significance

Statistical significance is commonly used to test the effectiveness of new medical products, including drugs, devices, and vaccines. Public reports of statistical significance also provide investors with information about the success of a company's new product launches. Pharmaceutical companies' stock prices are often significantly affected by announcements regarding the statistical significance of new products.[4]

## Conclusion

Statistical significance is the result of hypothesis testing, yielding a p-value or the probability that two or more variables are related due to non-random causes. Typically, a p-value of 5% is considered the threshold. The lower the p-value, the higher the statistical significance of the dataset results.

This form of testing is commonly used in drug trials, and investors, particularly those looking to evaluate companies launching new products, can also benefit from it.
