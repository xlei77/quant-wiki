## What is R-squared?

R-squared (R²) is a numerical value that measures how well the independent variables in a statistical model explain the variance of the dependent variable. Its values range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit between the model and the data.

### Key Points

- R-squared is a statistical measure that represents how much of the dependent variable's variance can be explained by the independent variables in a regression model.
- In investing, R-squared is typically interpreted as the percentage of a fund's or security's price movements that can be explained by movements in the benchmark index.
- An R-squared of 100% means that all movements of the security (or other dependent variable) can be completely explained by movements in the index (or the independent variable you're examining).

## R-squared Formula

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{R}^2 = 1 - \frac{ \text{未解释变异} }{ \text{总变异} } \\ \end{aligned} $$

Calculating R-squared requires several steps. This includes taking data points (observations) of dependent and independent variables and performing regression analysis to find the line of best fit, typically from a regression model. This regression line helps visualize the relationship between variables. Next, you need to calculate predicted values, subtract them from actual values, and square the results. These coefficient estimates and predicted values are crucial for understanding the relationship between variables. This will produce a series of squared errors, which are then summed to obtain the unexplained variance.

When calculating total variance, you need to subtract the mean actual value from each actual value, square the results, and sum them up. This process helps determine the total sum of squares, which is an essential component in calculating R-squared. Afterward, divide the first sum of errors (unexplained variation) by the second sum (total variation), and subtract this result from 1 to obtain R-squared.

## Understanding R-squared

R-squared represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables. A value of 1 means that all variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variables, while 0 indicates that the independent variables explain none of the variance. R-squared should be interpreted alongside other statistical results and contextual information, as high R-squared values can be misleading in cases of model overfitting. While correlation explains the strength of the relationship between independent and dependent variables, R-squared explains how much of the variance in one variable is explained by the variance in the second variable. Therefore, if a model has an R-squared of 0.50, approximately half of the observed variance can be explained by the model's inputs.

## What Can R-squared Tell You

In investing, R-squared is typically interpreted as the percentage of a fund's or security's movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. For example, R-squared between a fixed-income security and a bond index can identify what proportion of the security's price movements can be predicted based on index price movements.

The same analysis applies to the relationship between a stock and the S&P 500 index or any other relevant index. This is also commonly known as the coefficient of determination.

R-squared values range from 0 to 1, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%. An R-squared of 100% means that all movements of the security (or other dependent variable) are completely explained by movements in the index (or the independent variable you are interested in).

In investing, a high R-squared (85% to 100%) indicates that the stock or fund's performance moves relatively consistently with the index. A fund with a low R-squared (70% or lower) indicates that the fund typically doesn't follow the movements of the index. Higher R-squared values will indicate more useful beta values. For example, if a stock or fund has an R-squared value close to 100% but a beta less than 1, it is likely to provide higher risk-adjusted returns.

## R-squared and Adjusted R-squared

R-squared only works as expected in a simple linear regression model with a single independent variable. In multiple regression containing multiple independent variables, R-squared must be adjusted.

Adjusted R-squared compares the descriptive power of regression models containing different numbers of predictor variables. This is typically evaluated using measures of goodness of fit such as R-squared. With each additional predictor variable, R-squared increases and never decreases. Therefore, models with more terms may appear to fit better simply because they have more terms, while adjusted R-squared compensates for the increase in variables; it only increases when new terms improve the model's fit beyond probabilistic expectations, and decreases when the improvement from predictor variables falls below probabilistic expectations.

In cases of overfitting, an unreasonably high R-squared value may be obtained even when the model's predictive power actually decreases, while adjusted R-squared does not exhibit this issue.

## R-squared and Beta

Beta and R-squared are two related but distinct correlation measures. Beta is a relative risk measure. Mutual funds with high R-squared are highly correlated with their benchmark. If the beta value is also high, they may provide returns exceeding the benchmark during bull markets.

R-squared measures the correlation between each asset price movement and its benchmark. Beta measures the magnitude of these price movements relative to the benchmark. Using R-squared and beta together provides investors with a comprehensive picture of the asset manager's performance. A beta value of exactly 1.0 indicates that the asset has the same risk (volatility) as its benchmark.

Essentially, R-squared is a statistical analysis technique used to evaluate the practical application and reliability of a security's beta.

## Limitations of R-squared

R-squared provides you with an estimate of how changes in independent variables affect changes in the dependent variable. However, it cannot tell you whether your chosen model is good or bad, nor can it indicate whether there are biases in the data and predictions.

A high or low R-squared value isn't necessarily good or bad—it doesn't convey the reliability of the model or whether you've chosen the correct regression. You might get a good model with a low R-squared value, or a poorly fitted model with a high R-squared value, and vice versa.

## Suggestions for Improving R-squared

Improving R-squared typically requires a nuanced approach to model optimization. One potential strategy involves careful consideration of feature selection and engineering. By identifying and including only the most relevant predictive factors, you can increase the likelihood of explaining relationships. This process may involve conducting comprehensive exploratory data analysis or using techniques like stepwise regression or regularization to select the optimal set of variables.

Another approach to improving R-squared is addressing multicollinearity. Multicollinearity refers to high correlation between independent variables. This can distort coefficient estimates and reduce model accuracy. Techniques such as variance inflation factor analysis or principal component analysis can help identify and mitigate multicollinearity.

You can also improve R-squared by optimizing model specification and considering non-linear relationships between variables. This might involve exploring higher-order terms, interactions, or transforming variables in different ways to better capture underlying relationships between data points. In some cases, strong domain knowledge is necessary to gain this type of insight.

## What Can R-squared Tell You?

R-squared indicates what proportion of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variables in the regression model. It measures the goodness of fit of the model to the observed data, indicating how well the model's predictions match the actual data points.

## Can R-squared Be Negative?

No, R-squared cannot be negative. It always falls between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the independent variable explains none of the variability in the dependent variable, and 1 indicates a perfect fit of the model to the data.

## Why is the R-squared Value So Low?

A low R-squared value indicates that the independent variables in the regression model do not effectively explain the variance in the dependent variable. This could be due to missing relevant variables, non-linear relationships, or inherent variability in the data that cannot be captured by the model.

## What is a "Good" R-squared Value?

What constitutes a "good" R-squared value depends on the context. In some fields, such as social sciences, even relatively low R-squared values (like 0.5) can be considered relatively robust. In other fields, higher standards may be more stringent, such as 0.9 and above. In finance, an R-squared above 0.7 is generally viewed as showing high correlation, while below 0.4 indicates low correlation. However, this is not a hard rule, and specific analysis will depend on the particular circumstances.

## Is a Higher R-squared Better?

This again depends on the context. If you're looking for an index fund that aims to track a specific index as closely as possible, then you would want the fund's R-squared value to be as high as possible, as its goal is to match rather than deviate from that index. On the other hand, if you're looking for actively managed funds, a higher R-squared value might be seen as a bad sign, indicating that the fund manager isn't providing enough value relative to the benchmark.

## Conclusion

R-squared can be very useful in investment and other fields for determining the degree of influence that one or more independent variables have on a dependent variable. However, its limitations make it less than perfect for predictive purposes.
