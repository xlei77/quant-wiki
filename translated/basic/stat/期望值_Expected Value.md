## What is Expected Value?

Expected Value (EV) is a commonly used term in the investment industry that represents the anticipated average value of an investment at a future point in time. Investors use expected value to estimate the value of investments, typically analyzing it relative to its risk.

By calculating expected value, investors can select scenarios that are most likely to achieve the desired outcomes. In statistics and probability analysis, expected value is calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability of occurrence, then summing all these values.

### Key Points

- Expected value describes the long-term average level of a random variable based on its probability distribution.
- In investing, the expected value of stocks or other investments is an important consideration and is used in scenario analysis.
- Modern Portfolio Theory combines expected value with investment risk (standard deviation) to construct optimized portfolios.
- Expected value can help investors evaluate whether an investment's risk is worth its potential return.

## Understanding Expected Value

Expected value refers to the anticipated value of future assets. The expected value of a random variable provides a measure of the center of that variable's distribution. The expected value is essentially the long-term average of that variable.

According to the Law of Large Numbers, as the number of repetitions approaches infinity, the average value of a variable converges to its expected value. Expected value is also known as expectation, mean, or first moment.

Expected value can be calculated for single discrete variables, single continuous variables, multiple discrete variables, and multiple continuous variables. In the case of continuous variables, integration is required.

Scenario analysis is a technique for calculating the expected value of investment opportunities. It uses estimated probabilities and multivariate models to examine possible outcomes of an investment. Scenario analysis also helps investors determine whether their level of risk is appropriate for the expected outcome.

**Important Note:** The difference between expected value and arithmetic mean is that the former involves probability distributions, while the latter involves the distribution of occurred events.

## Expected Value Formula

The formula for expected value is:

$$ \begin{aligned} EV=\sum P(X_i)\times X_i\end{aligned} $$

Where:

- X is a random variable
- Xi is a specific value of X
- P(Xi) is the probability of Xi occurring

Therefore, the expected value of a random variable X is the sum of the products of each value of the random variable and its corresponding probability.

## Expected Value in Portfolio Construction

When constructing investment or financial portfolios, investors need to understand several key factors, including how assets operate and their associated risks. Investors should also be clear about their financial situation, investment objectives, and investment timeframe.

Once these factors are thoroughly understood, investors and their financial advisors can use expected value to construct portfolios that maximize returns while minimizing risk.

You can use expected value to determine the potential returns of investments, helping you choose which assets to include in your portfolio to match your return preferences.

For example, when calculating expected value, first multiply the probability of a positive outcome by the potential return. If an investment has a 60% chance of gaining $10,000, the calculation would be: 0.6 x $10,000 = $6,000.

Then, multiply the probability of a negative outcome by the potential loss. For instance, if the same investment has a 40% chance of losing $5,000, the calculation would be: 0.4 x $5,000 = $2,000.

Finally, subtract the second result from the first: $6,000 - $2,000 = $4,000. This is the expected value of that investment.

Next, you can compare two or more investments of interest by following the same steps and comparing their expected returns. This can help you make choices when constructing your portfolio.

Remember also that different assets can have different expected values. That is, stocks have different expected values (and risk characteristics) than bonds or Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). It's valuable to calculate and compare expected values for the various types of assets you're interested in.

You can also use expected value to make adjustments after your portfolio is constructed. For example, compare expected values to decide whether to sell an underperforming asset with no expectation of increase and replace it with another asset that has a higher expected value.

## Expected Value Example

To calculate the expected value of a single discrete random variable, you must multiply each value of the variable by its probability of occurrence.

Take a regular six-sided die as an example. When you roll the die, it has a one-sixth probability of landing on any value from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Based on this information, the calculation is:

$$ \begin{aligned}\left(\frac{1}{6}\times1\right)&+\left(\frac{1}{6}\times2\right)+\left(\frac{1}{6}\times3\right)\\&+\left(\frac{1}{6}\times4\right)+\left(\frac{1}{6}\times5\right)+\left(\frac{1}{6}\times6\right)=3.5\end{aligned} $$

If you roll a six-sided die an infinite number of times, you will find that the average equals 3.5.

## What is the Expected Value of Dividend-Paying Stocks?

The expected value of a stock is estimated as the Net Present Value (NPV) of all future dividends from that stock. If you can estimate the dividend growth rate, you can use dividend discount models (such as the Gordon Growth Model) to predict how much investors would be willing to pay for the stock. However, it's important to note that this is a different formula from the statistical expected value discussed in this article.

## How to Find the Expected Value of Non-Dividend Paying Stocks?

For stocks that don't pay dividends, analysts typically use multiple-based methods to determine expected values. For example, the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is commonly used and compared with industry peers. Thus, if the average P/E ratio in the technology sector is 25x, the expected value of a tech stock would be 25 times its earnings per share. While this differs from the statistical expected value discussed in this article, it represents another common approach to examining stock values.

## How is Stock Expected Value Applied in Portfolio Theory?

Modern portfolio theory and related models use mean-variance optimization to derive risk-adjusted optimal portfolio allocations. Risk is measured as the portfolio's standard deviation, while the mean represents the portfolio's expected value (expected return). This indeed utilizes the concepts discussed in this article.

## Conclusion

Understanding the concept of expected value is crucial for investors. It helps them assess the potential level of returns from investments. Expected value combined with scenario analysis can provide insights into the relationship between investment risk and return, helping investors decide whether to include it in their portfolio.
