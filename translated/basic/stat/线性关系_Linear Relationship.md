## What is a Linear Relationship?

A linear relationship (or linear correlation) is a statistical term used to describe a straight-line relationship between two variables. A linear relationship can be expressed graphically, where variables and constants are connected by a straight line, or mathematically, where the independent variable is multiplied by a slope coefficient and added to a constant to determine the dependent variable.

Linear relationships can be contrasted with polynomial or nonlinear (curved) relationships.

### Key Points

- Linear relationship (or linear correlation) is a statistical term used to describe a straight-line relationship between two variables.
- Linear relationships can be represented graphically or in the form of a mathematical equation as y = mx + b.
- Linear relationships are quite common in everyday life.

## Linear Relationship Formula

In mathematics, a linear relationship satisfies the following equation:

$$ \begin{aligned} &y = mx + b \\ &\textbf{其中:}\\ &m=\text{斜率}\\ &b=\text{y轴截距}\\ \end{aligned} $$

In this equation, "x" and "y" are two variables related by parameters "m" and "b". Graphically, y = mx + b plots as a straight line in the x-y plane with slope "m" and y-intercept "b". The y-intercept "b" is the value of "y" when x=0. The slope "m" can be calculated using any two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):

$$ m = \frac{(y_2 - y_1)}{(x_2 - x_1)} $$

## What Does a Linear Relationship Tell You?

To be properly defined as a linear relationship, an equation must meet three necessary criteria: the equation expressing the linear relationship should not contain more than two variables, all variables in the equation must be first-order, and the graph of the equation must be a straight line.

A commonly used linear relationship is correlation, which describes the degree to which one variable changes linearly with respect to changes in another variable.

In econometrics, linear regression is a common method for generating linear relationships to explain various phenomena. It is often used to infer future predictions from past events. However, not all relationships are linear. Some data describe curved relationships (such as polynomial relationships), while other data cannot be parameterized.

## Linear Functions

In mathematics, similar to linear relationships is the concept of linear functions. In the case of a single variable, a linear function can be written as:

$$ \begin{aligned} &f(x) = mx + b \\ &\textbf{其中:}\\ &m=\text{斜率}\\ &b=\text{y轴截距}\\ \end{aligned} $$

This is identical to the given linear relationship formula, except that f(x) replaces y. This substitution emphasizes the mapping from x to f(x), whereas using y merely indicates that x and y are two quantities related through A and B.

$$ c \times f(A +B) = c \times f(A) + c \times f(B) $$

## Examples of Linear Relationships

Linear relationships are quite common in daily life. Taking the concept of velocity as an example, the formula we use to calculate velocity is as follows: velocity rate is the ratio of distance to time. If a traveler drives 44.1 miles on California Highway 99 from Sacramento to Marysville, and the entire journey takes about 45 minutes, their driving speed would be approximately 60 miles per hour.

Although there are multiple variables in this equation, it remains a linear equation because one of the variables (distance) is always constant.

Linear relationships can also be found in the equation distance = velocity × time. Since distance is typically a positive number, this linear relationship will be represented in the upper right quadrant of a linear graph.

If a tandem bicycle travels at 30 miles per hour for 20 hours, the riders will cover 600 miles. Graphically, with distance on the Y-axis and time on the X-axis, the line tracking distance over 20 hours will extend outward from the intersection of the X and Y axes.

When converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures, the following equations can be used. These equations manifest as linear relationships on a graph:

$$ \degree C = \frac{5}{9}(\degree F - 32) $$

$$ \degree F = \frac{9}{5}\degree C + 32 $$

Suppose the independent variable is a house's area (in square feet), and its relationship with the house's market price (dependent variable) is: house area multiplied by a slope coefficient of 207.65, plus a constant $10,500。如果一所房屋的面积为1250平方英尺，则其市场价值为 (1,250 x 207.65) + $10,500 = $270,062.50。在图形和数学上，它看起来如下：

在这个例子中，随着房屋面积的增加，房屋的市场价值线性增加。

某些对象之间的线性关系可以称为“成比例关系”。该关系表现为：

$$ \begin{aligned} &Y = k \times X \\ &\textbf{其中:}\\ &k=\text{常数}\\ &Y, X=\text{成比例的量}\\ \end{aligned} $$

When analyzing behavioral data, perfect linear relationships between variables are rare. However, trends forming approximate linear relationships can often be found in the data. For example, one can observe daily ice cream sales and daily maximum temperature as two interacting variables on a chart and find a rough linear relationship between them.

## What is a Positive Linear Relationship?

A positive linear relationship appears as an upward straight line in a graph. This means that when one variable increases, the other variable also increases. In contrast, a negative linear relationship appears as a downward straight line in a graph; when one variable increases, the other variable decreases.

## What is a Non-linear Relationship?

A non-linear relationship can be visualized through a scatter plot on a graph, where the points follow a certain pattern, but this pattern is not linear, meaning it cannot be represented by a straight line.

## What is an example of linear relationships in statistics?

A common example of a linear relationship is hourly-paid workers. The more hours they work, the more money they earn. This relationship is linear because each additional hour worked corresponds to an equal increase in income.

## Summary

Linear relationships in statistics demonstrate a straight-line relationship between two variables. It typically shows the correlation between two variables. Although no perfect behavioral relationship can generate a truly linear relationship, trends can usually be found in the data to assume its existence.
