## What is the Merton Model?

The Merton model is a mathematical formula that stock analysts and commercial loan officers can use to evaluate a company's credit default risk. The model is named after economist Robert C. Merton, who proposed this theory in 1974. The Merton model assesses a company's structural credit risk by treating the company's equity as a call option on its assets.

### Key Points

- In 1974, economist Robert C. Merton proposed a model for evaluating credit risk by modeling a company's equity as a call option on its assets.
- Today, stock analysts, commercial loan officers, and others use the Merton model.
- Merton and his fellow economist Myron S. Scholes were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997 for their work.

## Merton Model Formula

$$ \begin{aligned} &E=V_tN\left(d_1\right)-Ke^{-r\Delta{T}}N\left(d_2\right)\\ &\textbf{其中：}\\ &d_1=\frac{\ln{\frac{V_t}{K}}+\left(r+\frac{\sigma_v^2}{2}\right)\Delta{T}}{\sigma_v\sqrt{\Delta{T}}}\\ &\text{和}\\ &d_2=d_1-\sigma_v\sqrt{\Delta{T}}\\ &\text{E = 公司股本的理论价值}\\ &V_t=\text{公司在t时点的资产价值}\\ &\text{K = 公司债务的价值}\\ &\text{t = 当前时间段}\\ &\text{T = 未来时间段}\\ &\text{r = 无风险利率}\\ &\text{N = 累积分布标准正态分布}\\ &\text{e = 指数项}\left(例如\text{ }2.7183...\right)\\ &\sigma=\text{股票收益的标准差}\\ \end{aligned} $$

## What Can the Merton Model Tell Us?

The Merton model makes company valuation simpler, helping analysts assess whether a company can maintain solvency by analyzing its debt maturities and total obligations.

The model calculates theoretical pricing for European put and call options without considering dividends paid during the option's lifetime. However, the model can be adjusted to account for dividends by calculating the ex-dividend value of the underlying stock.

The Merton model makes the following basic assumptions:

- All options are European options, exercisable only at expiration.
- No dividends are paid.
- Market volatility is unpredictable (efficient market).
- Commissions are not included.
- The underlying stock's volatility and risk-free rate are constant.
- Returns of the underlying stock follow a normal distribution.

Variables considered in the formula include the option's strike price, current underlying price, risk-free rate, and time to expiration.

## History of the Merton Model

Robert C. Merton is a renowned American economist and Nobel laureate who bought his first stock at the age of 10. He received his bachelor's degree in Engineering from Columbia University, a master's degree in Applied Mathematics from Caltech, and a Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he later became a professor.

While working at MIT, Merton collaborated with fellow economists Fischer Black and Myron S. Scholes on option pricing problems, supporting each other's research. Black and Scholes published their groundbreaking paper "The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities" in 1973. Merton followed with his paper "On the Pricing of Corporate Debt: The Risk Structure of Interest Rates" in early 1974, describing what would later become known as the Merton Model.

Merton and Scholes were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997 (Black had passed away and was therefore ineligible). The prize committee recognized them for developing "a pioneering formula for the valuation of stock options. Their methodology has paved the way for economic valuations in many areas and has created new financial instruments that enable more effective risk management in society."

Their most famous collaboration is now commonly known as the Black-Scholes-Merton Model.

## What is a Call Option?

A call option is a contract that gives the buyer the right to purchase a stock or other financial asset at a specified price before a specific date.

## What is the difference between European options and American options?

European options can only be exercised on the expiration date, while American options can be exercised at any time before expiration.

## What is the Risk-Free Rate?

The risk-free rate refers to the rate of return on an investment that theoretically carries zero risk. It is theoretical because no investment is completely risk-free, although some investments have risks that are close to zero.

## Summary

The Merton model is a mathematical formula developed by economist Robert C. Merton that evaluates a company's structural credit risk by treating its equity as a call option on its assets. The model is commonly used by stock analysts and commercial loan officers to assess the potential credit default risk faced by companies.
