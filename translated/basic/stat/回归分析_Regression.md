## What is Regression Analysis?

Regression analysis is a statistical method widely used in finance, investment, and other disciplines, aimed at determining the strength and characteristics of relationships between dependent variables and one or more independent variables.

Linear regression is the most common form of this technique. Linear regression, also known as simple regression or Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), establishes a linear relationship between two variables.

Linear regression is graphically represented through a best-fit line, where the slope defines how a change in one variable affects the change in another variable. The y-intercept of a linear regression relationship represents the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero. Non-linear regression models also exist, but they are typically more complex.

### Key Points

- Regression is a statistical technique that associates dependent variables with one or more independent variables.
- Regression models can show whether changes in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more independent variables.
- This is primarily achieved by determining the best-fit line and observing how data is distributed around this line.
- Regression analysis helps economists and financial analysts in various aspects of work, from asset valuation to forecasting.
- Multiple assumptions about the data and the model itself must be satisfied to correctly interpret regression results.

In economics, regression analysis is used to help investment managers evaluate asset values and understand the relationship between commodity prices and the stocks of companies dealing with these commodities.

Although regression analysis is a powerful tool for revealing associations between variables in data, it cannot easily indicate causation. Regression as a statistical technique should not be confused with the concept of "regression to the mean," which refers to mean reversion.

## Understanding Regression Analysis

Regression analysis captures correlations between variables in a dataset and quantifies whether these correlations are statistically significant.

The two basic types of regression are simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, although nonlinear regression methods exist for more complex data analysis. Simple linear regression uses one independent variable to explain or predict the outcome of dependent variable Y, while multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables for prediction. Analysts can examine each independent variable included in the linear regression model through stepwise regression.

Regression analysis can help finance and investment professionals. For example, a company might use it to predict sales based on weather, historical sales figures, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, or other conditions. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a commonly used regression model in finance, primarily used for asset pricing and determining cost of capital.

Econometrics is a set of statistical techniques used to analyze financial and economic data. One application of econometrics is studying income effects using observable data. Economists might hypothesize that as an individual's income increases, their spending also increases.

If the data indicates such a relationship exists, regression analysis can be performed to understand the strength of the relationship between income and consumption and whether this relationship is statistically significant.

It's important to note that there can be multiple independent variables in the analysis; for example, changes in GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates can all be used to explain stock market prices. When using more than one independent variable, it's called multiple linear regression. This is the most commonly used tool in econometrics.

Econometrics is sometimes criticized for relying too heavily on interpreting regression outputs without connecting them to economic theory or seeking causal mechanisms. It is crucial that findings revealed in the data can be reasonably explained through theory.

## Regression Analysis Calculation

Linear regression models typically use the least squares method to determine the best-fit line. The least squares method is achieved by minimizing the sum of squares produced by a mathematical function. The squares are calculated by squaring the distances between data points and either the regression line or the mean of the dataset.

After completing this process (nowadays typically done using software), the regression model is constructed. The general forms for each type of regression model are as follows:

Simple Linear Regression: 1

$$ \begin{aligned}&Y = a + bX + u \\\end{aligned} $$

Multiple Linear Regression: 2

$$ \begin{aligned}&Y = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3X_3 + ... + b_tX_t + u \\&\textbf{其中:} \\&Y = \text{您试图预测或解释的因变量} \\&X = \text{解释性的（自变量）} \\&\text{变量，您用它来预测或与Y相关联} \\&a = \text{y截距} \\&b = \text{（beta系数）是解释性变量的斜率} \\&u = \text{回归残差或误差项} \\\end{aligned} $$

## Applications of Regression Analysis in Finance

Regression analysis is commonly used to determine how specific factors (such as commodity prices, interest rates, specific industries or sectors) affect asset price movements. The CAPM mentioned above is based on regression analysis and is used to predict expected stock returns and calculate the cost of capital. A stock's returns are regressed against the returns of a broader index (such as the S&P 500) to generate a Beta value for that stock.

Beta value represents the stock's risk relative to the market or index, reflected as the slope in CAPM. The stock's returns serve as the dependent variable Y, while the market risk premium is the independent variable X.

Additional variables such as market capitalization, valuation ratios, and recent returns can be added to CAPM to obtain better return predictions. These additional factors are known as Fama-French factors, named after the professors who developed the multiple linear regression model to better explain asset returns.[3]

## Why is Regression Named So?

Although there is some controversy about the origin of this name, this statistical technique was likely established by Sir Francis Galton in the 19th century to describe the statistical characteristic of biological data (such as people's height in a population) regressing toward some average level. In other words, while there are shorter and taller people, only outliers would be extremely tall or extremely short, with most people clustering around or "regressing" to some average value. [4]

## What is the Purpose of Regression Analysis?

In statistical analysis, regression is used to identify relationships between variables that appear in data. It can show the magnitude of these relationships and determine their statistical significance. Regression is a powerful statistical inference tool that attempts to predict future outcomes based on past observations.

## How to Interpret a Regression Model?

A regression model output may appear as Y = 1.0 + (3.2)X1 - 2.0(X2) + 0.21.

This is a multiple linear regression with two explanatory variables X1 and X2. In this model, we can interpret that: for each unit change in X1, Y will change by 3.2 (if X1 increases by 2, Y increases by 6.4, etc.), assuming all else remains constant. This means that, while controlling for X2, X1 has this observed relationship. Similarly, holding X1 constant, for each unit increase in X2, Y will decrease by 2 units. We can also note that the y-intercept is 1.0, meaning that when both X1 and X2 are zero, Y equals 1. The error term (residual) is 0.21.[2]

## What assumptions must regression models satisfy?

To correctly interpret regression model outputs, the following main assumptions about the underlying data process you are analyzing must be satisfied:

- The relationship between variables is linear;
- Homoscedasticity must exist, meaning the variance of variables and error terms must remain constant;
- All explanatory variables are independent of each other;
- All variables follow a normal distribution.[5]

## Summary

Regression is a statistical method aimed at determining the strength and characteristics of relationships between a dependent variable and a series of other variables. It is used in finance, investment, and other disciplines.

Regression analysis reveals correlations between variables in data but cannot easily indicate causation.
