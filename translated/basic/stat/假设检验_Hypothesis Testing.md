## What is Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis testing, sometimes called significance testing, is a statistical procedure through which analysts examine hypotheses about population parameters. The approach taken by analysts depends on the nature of the data used and the purpose of the analysis.

Hypothesis testing is used to evaluate the reasonableness of a hypothesis using sample data. This data may come from a larger population or a data-generating process. In the following description, the term "population" will be used for both cases.

### Key Points

- Hypothesis testing is used to evaluate the reasonableness of a hypothesis through sample data.
- Testing provides evidence regarding the reasonableness of the hypothesis.
- Statistical analysts test hypotheses by measuring and examining random samples from the population being analyzed.
- The four steps of hypothesis testing include stating the hypothesis, formulating an analysis plan, analyzing sample data, and interpreting results.

## How Hypothesis Testing Works

In hypothesis testing, analysts test a statistical sample with the aim of providing evidence about the reasonableness of the null hypothesis. Statistical analysts measure and examine random samples from the population being analyzed. All analysts use random population samples to test two different hypotheses: the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.

The null hypothesis is typically an equality hypothesis between population parameters; for example, the null hypothesis might state that the population mean return equals zero. The alternative hypothesis is effectively the opposite of the null hypothesis. Therefore, they are mutually exclusive, and only one can be true. However, one of these two hypotheses must be correct.

**Important Note:** The null hypothesis is a statement about population parameters, such as the population mean, that is assumed to be true.

## Four-Step Process

## Examples of Hypothesis Testing

Suppose someone wants to test whether the probability of a coin landing heads is truly 50%, the null hypothesis would be that 50% is correct, and the alternative hypothesis would be that 50% is incorrect. Mathematically, the null hypothesis is expressed as Ho: P = 0.5. The alternative hypothesis is denoted as "Ha" and is similar to the null hypothesis except that the equals sign is removed, indicating that it is not equal to 50%.

A sample of 100 coin flips is randomly selected for testing. If the results show 40 heads and 60 tails out of 100 flips, the analyst would assume that the probability of heads is not 50%, thus rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting the alternative hypothesis.

If the results show 48 heads and 52 tails, then the coin might be fair, as it could still produce such results. In this case, when the null hypothesis is "accepted," the analyst would indicate that the difference between the expected results (50 heads and 50 tails) and the observed results (48 heads and 52 tails) is "explainable by random factors alone."

## When Did Hypothesis Testing Begin?

Some statisticians credit the first hypothesis test to John Arbuthnot, a satirist in 1710, who studied male and female births in England after observing that male births slightly outnumbered female births almost every year. Arbuthnot calculated that the probability of this occurring by chance was very small, and therefore concluded it was a "Divine Providence."

## What are the Benefits of Hypothesis Testing?

Hypothesis testing helps evaluate the accuracy of new ideas or theories by comparing them with data. This enables researchers to determine whether evidence supports their hypotheses, thereby avoiding incorrect claims and conclusions. Hypothesis testing also provides a framework for making decisions based on data rather than personal opinions or biases. By relying on statistical analysis, hypothesis testing helps reduce the influence of random factors and confounding variables, providing a robust framework for making informed conclusions.

## What are the limitations of hypothesis testing?

Hypothesis testing relies entirely on data and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject being studied. Additionally, the accuracy of results depends on the quality of available data and the statistical methods used. Inaccurate data or improper hypothesis formulation can lead to incorrect conclusions or test failures. Hypothesis testing can also result in errors, such as when analysts accept or reject the null hypothesis when they shouldn't. These errors can lead to incorrect conclusions or failure to identify significant patterns or relationships in the data.

## Conclusion

Hypothesis testing is a statistical process that helps researchers determine the reliability of their research. Through the use of well-formulated hypotheses and a series of statistical tests, individuals or businesses can make inferences about the population being studied and draw conclusions based on the presented data. All hypothesis testing methods follow the same four-step process, which includes stating the hypothesis, developing an analysis plan, analyzing sample data, and interpreting results.
