## What is Uniform Distribution?

In statistics, a uniform distribution refers to a probability distribution where all possible outcomes have equal probability of occurring. Probability distributions help you determine the likelihood of future events.

For example, when drawing from a deck of cards, the probability of drawing hearts, clubs, diamonds, or spades is equal, so a uniform distribution of playing cards is expected. Flipping a coin is another example of uniform distribution, as the probability of getting heads or tails is the same.

A uniform distribution can be visualized as a horizontal line. Taking coin flips as an example, the probability of getting heads or tails is 50% each (p = 0.50), and when plotted on a graph, the y-axis value remains at 0.50.

### Key Points

- Uniform distribution is a probability distribution where all outcomes have equal probability of occurrence.
- In discrete uniform distribution, outcomes are discrete and have equal probability.
- In continuous uniform distribution, outcomes are continuous and infinite.
- In normal distribution, data appears more frequently around the mean than data far from the mean.
- Uniform distributions can be plotted on graphs.

## Understanding Uniform Distribution

There are two types of uniform distributions: discrete and continuous.

The outcome of rolling a die provides an example of a discrete uniform distribution. Possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, but it's impossible to roll a 2.3, 4.7, or 5.5. Therefore, rolling a die generates a discrete distribution, with a probability of 1/6 for each outcome. There are only 6 possible return values, with no values in between, and the possibilities are finite.

In contrast, continuous uniform distribution has infinite distribution possibilities. An idealized random number generator can be viewed as a continuous uniform distribution. For this distribution, every point between 0.0 and 1.0 has an equal chance of occurring, and there are infinite points within this interval.

There are many other important continuous distributions, such as the normal distribution, chi-square distribution, and Student's t-distribution.

Additionally, there are several distribution-related functions for data generation or data analysis that help explain variables and their variance in datasets. These functions include probability density functions, cumulative density, and moment-generating functions.

**Note:** In statistics, the term "discrete" refers to variables that have single countable and finite possible values.

## Visualizing Uniform Distribution

Distribution is a simple way to visualize a set of data. It can be displayed in the form of charts or lists, showing the probability of different values of random variables occurring. The uniform distribution is perhaps the simplest of all probability distributions.

In a uniform distribution, all possible values have the same probability of occurring. When displayed as a bar chart or line graph, this distribution shows the same height for each possible outcome. As a result, its shape looks like a rectangle, which is why it's sometimes called a rectangular distribution.

Taking the example of drawing a suit from a deck of cards, the random chance of drawing hearts or spades is the same, both being 1/4 or 25%.

Rolling a die produces one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since there are only 6 possible outcomes, the probability of rolling any one of them is 16.67% (1/6). When plotted on a graph, the possible outcomes are fixed on the x-axis, with probability values represented on the y-axis.

## Examples of Uniform Distribution

A standard deck of playing cards contains 52 cards, including four suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades. Each suit contains A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K. While the deck also includes 2 jokers, in this example we will ignore the jokers and face cards, focusing only on the number cards in each suit. Therefore, we have 40 cards remaining, forming a discrete dataset.

Suppose you want to know the probability of drawing a Hearts 2 from this modified deck, the probability is 1/40 or 2.5%. Each card is unique, so the probability of drawing any particular card from the deck is the same.

Now, let's consider the probability of drawing a Hearts card. This probability is significantly higher. Why? Because we are now only concerned with the suit of the cards. Since there are only four suits, the probability of drawing a Hearts is 1/4 or 25%.

**Note:** The results of a single die roll will be discretely uniform, while the results (average) of multiple dice rolls (multiple dice) will follow a normal distribution.

## Uniform Distribution and Normal Distribution

Some of the most common probability distributions include:

- Discrete Uniform Distribution
- Binomial Distribution
- Continuous Uniform Distribution
- Normal Distribution
- Exponential Distribution

Perhaps the most familiar and widely used is the Normal Distribution, typically appearing as a bell-shaped curve. The Normal Distribution shows the distribution of continuous data, with most data concentrated around the mean or average value.

In a Normal Distribution, the area under the curve equals 1, with 68.27% of data falling within one standard deviation (measure of data dispersion) of the mean; 95.45% falling within two standard deviations, and approximately 99.73% falling within three standard deviations of the mean. The frequency of occurrence decreases as data points move away from the mean.

The Discrete Uniform Distribution indicates that variables within a certain range have equal probability of occurrence. Its possible outcomes have no variation, and the data is discrete rather than continuous. The shape resembles a rectangle rather than the bell shape of the Normal Distribution. Nevertheless, the area under the graph still equals 1.

## What is a Uniform Distribution?

A uniform distribution is a probability distribution that indicates the likelihood of outcomes in a discrete data set is equal for each value.

## What is the formula for uniform distribution?

The formula for discrete uniform distribution is:
$$ \begin{aligned}&P_x = \frac{ 1 }{ n } \\&\textbf{其中：} \\&P_x = \text{离散值的概率} \\&n = \text{范围内的值的数量} \\\end{aligned} $$

## Is Uniform Distribution Normal?

No, uniform distribution is not normal. Normal distribution describes how data is distributed around the mean, indicating that the probability of a variable occurring near the mean is higher than the probability of occurring far from the mean. The probability of occurrence in normal data is not uniform, while in uniform distribution, the probability of occurrence is constant.

## What is the Expected Value of a Uniform Distribution?

The expected value of a uniform distribution is where all possible outcomes have the same probability. The probability of one variable is equal to the probability of another variable.

## Summary

The uniform distribution is one example of many probability distributions in statistics. A uniform distribution is one where all possible outcomes are finite and have equal probability of occurrence. For example, rolling a die will only present six possible outcomes, with each outcome having a probability of ⅙.
