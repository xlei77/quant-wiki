## What is Chi-square (χ2) Statistic?

The Chi-square (χ2) statistic is a test that measures the comparison between a model and actual observed data. The data used in calculating the chi-square statistic must be random, raw, mutually exclusive, and must come from independent variables, with a sufficiently large sample size. For example, the results of flipping a fair coin meet these criteria.

Chi-square tests are commonly used for hypothesis testing. The chi-square statistic compares the magnitude of any differences between expected and actual results while taking into account sample size and number of variables.

In these tests, degrees of freedom are used to determine whether a null hypothesis can be rejected based on the total number of variables and samples in the experiment. As with any statistic, the larger the sample size, the more reliable the results.

### Key Points

- Chi-square (χ2) statistic is a measure used to assess the difference between observed frequencies and expected frequencies of a set of events or variables.
- Chi-square is particularly useful in analyzing differences in categorical variables, especially those of nominal nature.
- χ2 depends on the magnitude of differences between actual and observed values, degrees of freedom, and sample size.
- χ2 can be used to test whether two variables are related or independent of each other.
- It can also be used to test the goodness of fit between an observed distribution and a theoretical frequency distribution.

## Chi-square (χ2) Statistic Formula

$$ \begin{aligned}&\chi^2_c = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \\&\textbf{其中:}\\&c=\text{自由度}\\&O=\text{观察值}\\&E=\text{预期值}\end{aligned} $$

## What Can the Chi-square (χ2) Statistic Tell You

There are two main types of chi-square tests, each providing different information:

- Independence test, which asks relationship questions, such as: "Is there a relationship between student gender and course selection?"
- Goodness-of-fit test, which asks theoretical questions, such as: "How well does my coin match a theoretically fair coin?"

**Note:** Chi-square analysis is applied to categorical variables and is particularly useful when these variables are nominal (i.e., order-independent, such as marital status or gender).

When considering student gender and course selection, the χ2 independence test can be used. When conducting this test, researchers collect data on two variables (gender and course selection), then use the above formula and χ2 statistical tables to compare the frequencies at which males and females choose the offered courses.

If there is no relationship between gender and course selection (i.e., they are independent), then the actual frequencies of males and females choosing each course should be roughly equal, or the proportion of males and females in each selected course should approximately equal the proportion of males and females in the sample.

The χ2 independence test can tell us the likelihood that random chance explains any observed differences between the actual frequencies in the data and these theoretical expectations.

In an independence test, a company might want to evaluate whether its new product—an herbal supplement claiming to boost energy—is reaching the people most likely to be interested in it.

It advertises on websites related to sports and fitness, assuming that actively health-conscious people would be most likely to buy. It conducts an extensive survey to assess interest in the product across demographic groups. The survey results show no correlation between interest in the product and the most health-conscious populations.

χ2 provides a way to test how well sample data matches the characteristics of a larger population (known or assumed), which is called goodness-of-fit.

If sample data doesn't match the expected characteristics of the population of interest, then the sample shouldn't be used to draw conclusions about the larger population.

As an example of a goodness-of-fit test, marketing professionals are considering launching a new product that the company believes will appeal to women over 45. The company has product-tested with 500 potential buyers.

The marketing professionals have information about the test group's age and gender. This makes it possible to construct a chi-square test showing the age and gender distribution of those who indicated they would buy the product.

The results will show whether the most likely buyers are women over 45. If the test shows that men over 45 or women aged 18-44 are equally likely to buy the product, the marketing professionals will adjust their advertising, promotion, and placement strategies to appeal to this broader customer base.

## Example of How to Use Chi-square (χ2) Statistic

For example, consider a hypothetical coin where the chances of heads and tails are 50/50, and you flip a real coin 100 times. If this coin is fair, it should have an equal probability of landing on either side, with the expected result for 100 flips being 50 heads and 50 tails.

In this case, χ2 can tell us how the actual results of 100 coin flips compare to the 50/50 result expected from the theoretical model of a fair coin. The actual results might be 50/50, or they could be 60/40, or even 90/10.

The larger the deviation from 50/50 in the actual results, the poorer the goodness of fit for this set of coin flips, making it more likely to conclude that the coin is not actually fair.

## When to Use Chi-square (χ2) Test

The chi-square test is used to help determine whether observed results are consistent with expected results, and to rule out the possibility that the observed results occurred by chance.

Chi-square tests are appropriate when the data being analyzed comes from a random sample and the variables in question are categorical. Categorical variables include choices such as car types, race, education level, gender, or how much someone likes a political candidate (ranging from strongly like to strongly dislike).

This type of data is typically collected through survey responses or questionnaires, making chi-square analysis particularly useful when analyzing such data.

## How to Perform Chi-square (χ2) Test

Here are the basic steps for conducting a goodness-of-fit test or independence test:

- Create a table of observed frequencies and expected frequencies.
- Calculate the chi-square value using the formula.
- Find the critical chi-square value using a chi-square table or statistical software.
- Determine which is larger between the chi-square value and the critical value.
- Reject or accept the null hypothesis.

## Limitations of Chi-square (χ2) Statistic

Chi-square tests are highly sensitive to sample size. When using very large samples, relationships may appear significant when they actually are not.

Furthermore, chi-square tests cannot determine whether one variable has a causal relationship with another variable. They can only determine whether two variables are correlated.

## What is the purpose of Chi-square test?

Chi-square is a statistical test used to examine differences between categorical variables from random samples to determine the goodness of fit between expected and observed results.

## Who Uses Chi-Square Analysis?

Due to chi-square's applicability to categorical variables, it is most commonly used by researchers studying survey response data. This type of research can involve fields such as demographics, consumer and market research, political science, and economics.

## When the Independent Variable is Nominal or Ordinal, Should Chi-Square Analysis Be Used?

A nominal variable is a variable categorized by quality, where the numerical order may be irrelevant. For example, asking someone's favorite color produces a nominal variable. On the other hand, asking someone's age produces an ordinal dataset. Chi-square analysis is best applied to nominal data.

## Summary

The chi-square statistic is used to measure the difference between observed and expected frequencies of a set of variables. It is particularly useful when analyzing differences in categorical variables, especially those of a nominal nature. Two different types of chi-square tests—the test of independence and the goodness-of-fit test—answer different types of relationship questions.
