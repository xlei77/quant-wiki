## What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)?

In probability theory, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of sample variables approaches a normal distribution (i.e., the "bell curve"), regardless of the actual shape of the population distribution.

In other words, CLT is a statistical premise that when taking a sufficiently large sample size from a population with finite variance, the mean of the selected sample variables will approximately equal the mean of the entire population. Furthermore, as the sample size increases, these samples will also approximate a normal distribution, and their variance will approach the population variance, all of which aligns with the Law of Large Numbers.

Although this concept was first proposed by Abraham de Moivre in 1733, it wasn't until 1920 that Hungarian mathematician George PÃ³lya formally named it the Central Limit Theorem.[1]

### Key Points

- The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the underlying population distribution.
- Generally, a sample size of 30 or larger is considered sufficient for CLT to hold.
- A key aspect of CLT is that the mean and standard deviation of sample means will equal the population mean and standard deviation.
- A sufficiently large sample size allows for more accurate prediction of population characteristics.
- In finance, the Central Limit Theorem is particularly useful when analyzing large numbers of securities to estimate portfolio distributions and characteristics of returns, risks, and correlations.

## Understanding the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

According to the Central Limit Theorem, as the sample size increases, the mean of data samples will approach closer to the mean of the population being studied, regardless of the actual distribution of the data. In other words, the data is accurate whether the distribution is normal or abnormal.

Typically, a sample size of around 30 is generally considered sufficient for the CLT to hold, meaning the distribution of sample means becomes relatively close to a normal distribution. Therefore, the more samples there are, the more the plotted results will exhibit the shape of a normal distribution.[3]

The Central Limit Theorem is often used in conjunction with the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as the sample size increases, the average of sample means will increasingly approach the population mean, which is extremely useful for accurately predicting population characteristics.

## Key Components of the Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem consists of several key characteristics. These characteristics primarily revolve around samples, sample size, and the overall population.

## Applications of the Central Limit Theorem in Finance

The CLT is particularly useful when examining returns of individual stocks or broader indices, as the analysis is relatively straightforward and generating the required financial data is comparatively easy. Therefore, various types of investors rely on the CLT to analyze stock returns, construct portfolios, and manage risks.

For example, if an investor wants to analyze the overall returns of a stock index composed of 1000 stocks, they can randomly sample a portion of stocks to estimate the expected returns of the entire index. To ensure reliability, they should sample at least 30 to 50 random stocks from different sectors for the central limit theorem to hold. Additionally, previously selected stocks should be replaced with different names to help eliminate bias.

## Why is the Central Limit Theorem So Useful?

The Central Limit Theorem is extremely useful when analyzing large datasets because it allows one to assume that the sampling distribution of sample means will follow a normal distribution in most cases. This makes statistical analysis and inference much simpler. For example, investors can use the Central Limit Theorem to aggregate performance data of individual securities and generate a distribution of sample means that represents the overall distribution of security returns.

## Why is the Minimum Sample Size for the Central Limit Theorem 30?

In statistics, a sample size of 30 is considered the common minimum threshold for applying the Central Limit Theorem.[6] The larger the sample size, the more likely the sample is to represent the overall population dataset.

## What is the Formula for the Central Limit Theorem?

The Central Limit Theorem doesn't have a specific formula in practical applications. Its principle is simple and applicable. As long as the sample size is large enough, the sample distribution will approximate a normal distribution, and the sample mean will approach the population mean. Therefore, if our sample size is at least 30, we can begin to treat the data analysis as conforming to a normal distribution.
