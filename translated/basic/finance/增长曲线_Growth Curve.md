## What is a Growth Curve?

A growth curve is a graphical representation that shows how something changes over time. Taking a country's population growth as an example, a growth curve might be a chart showing how that country's population increases over time.

Growth curves are widely used in statistics to determine how a quantity grows over timeâ€”whether it's linear, exponential, or cubic.[1] Businesses use growth curves to track or predict various factors, including future sales performance.

### Key Points

- Growth curves show how certain phenomena change over time, which can be historical, future-oriented, or both.
- Growth curves are typically displayed on a coordinate system where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis shows the growth amount.
- Growth curves have applications across multiple fields, from population biology and ecology to finance and economics.
- Growth curves enable monitoring of changes over time and the variables causing these changes. Businesses and investors can adjust their strategies based on growth curves.

## Understanding Growth Curves

When businesses determine whether to launch new products or enter new markets, the shape of growth curves can have significant implications. Markets with slow growth are less attractive because profit potential is limited. While exponential growth is typically seen as a positive signal, it can also indicate that the market will attract numerous competitors.

Growth curves were originally used in physical sciences, such as biology.[2] Today, they have also become common components in social sciences.[1]

Advances in digital technology and business models require analysts to consider unique growth patterns applicable to the modern economy. For example, the winner-takes-all phenomenon is a relatively new development driven by companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple. Researchers are working to understand the unique growth curves brought about by these new business models and platforms.

**Note:** Growth curves are typically associated with biology, allowing biologists to study organisms and their behavior in specific environments, as well as their responses to environmental changes in controlled settings.[2]

Population changes, the nature of work, and developments in artificial intelligence will further challenge traditional methods of growth curve or trend analysis.

Growth curve analysis plays a crucial role in determining future success of products, markets, and societies, both at micro and macro levels.

## Growth Curve Example

The growth curve shown in the figure below represents the population growth in millions over a ten-year period. The shape of this growth curve demonstrates exponential growth. This means that the growth curve initially remains flat and slow for an extended period, then rises rapidly, becoming almost vertical.

The curve follows the general formula:

The current value V, representing the initial point of exponential growth, can be determined by multiplying the starting value S by (1 plus the rate R) raised to the power of t, where t represents the number of periods elapsed.

In finance, exponential growth most commonly appears in the context of compound interest.

The power of compound interest is one of the most potent forces in finance. This concept enables investors to create substantial wealth from a small initial capital. Savings accounts with compound interest rates are common examples of this.

## What are the two types of growth curves?

The two types of growth curves are exponential growth curves and logarithmic growth curves. In exponential growth curves, the slope increases over time. In logarithmic growth curves, the slope initially increases rapidly, then gradually decreases over time until it becomes flat.

## Why Use Growth Curves?

Growth curves are useful visual representations of change over time. Growth curves can be used to understand various changes, such as developmental and economic changes. They help in understanding the effects of policies or treatments.

## What is a Business Growth Model?

A business growth model provides enterprises with a visualization tool to track various metrics and key drivers, enabling them to plan growth and adjust their operations accordingly to promote the development of these metrics.

## Conclusion

A growth curve is a chart that shows how a phenomenon changes over time. It can display both past and future trends. Growth curves typically use two axes, where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents growth.

Growth curves have applications across many disciplines, including scientific fields such as biology and ecology. They are also used in finance and economics. Businesses can use growth curves to observe how specific markets change over time, helping them decide whether to enter or exit a market, or adjust their sales strategies in response to changes.
