T+1 (T+2, T+3) refers to the abbreviation for securities trading settlement periods. Here, "T" represents the trading day, which is the day when the transaction occurs, while the numbers 1, 2, or 3 indicate the number of days required after the trading day for settlement, meaning the transfer of money and securities ownership.

### Key Points Summary

- T+1 (or T+2, T+3) refers to the abbreviation for trade settlement dates.
- The letter "T" represents the trading day, and the numbers 1, 2, or 3 indicate how many days after the trading day the settlement occurs.
- Stocks are T+1, while bonds, mutual funds, and money market funds have different settlement periods, including T+1, T+2, and T+3 scenarios.

## Understanding T+1 (T+2, T+3)

When determining T+1 (T+2, T+3) settlement periods, only stock market trading days are counted. For example, T+1 means if a trade occurs on Monday, settlement must be completed on Tuesday. T+3 means if a trade occurs on Monday, settlement must be completed on Thursday, provided there are no holidays in between. However, if you sell a security with T+3 settlement on Friday, the transfer of ownership and funds must wait until Wednesday of the following week.

Understanding stock settlement dates is crucial for investors or strategy traders focusing on dividend-paying companies, as settlement dates determine which party receives the dividend. In other words, trades must settle before the dividend record date for stock buyers to receive the dividend.

In the past, securities trading was manual rather than electronic, and investors had to wait for securities delivery, which was a physical certificate, and payment wasn't made until receipt. Due to varying delivery times and potential price fluctuations, market regulators established timeframes within which securities and cash must be delivered. For many years, stock settlement dates were traditionally T+5, meaning five business days after the trade date. Until recently, the settlement period was shortened to T+3, then changed to T+2 in 2017. In 2024, stock settlement time was reduced to T+1.

Settlement dates vary depending on the type of security. Currently, all stocks are T+1; however, bonds, mutual funds, and some money market funds may vary between T+1, T+2, and T+3.

**Note:** The settlement date is when investors become shareholders of record. Weekends and public holidays are not counted. Investors should be aware of settlement dates as they determine when they officially become shareholders of record, which may affect their eligibility to receive dividends.

## Stock T+1 Settlement Cycle

In May 2024, the U.S. stock market officially transitions to a "T+1" settlement cycle, where securities transactions will settle one business day after the trade date. This change was initially proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in February 2023, shortening the settlement cycle from the "T+2" standard that had been in place since 2017. The last time the U.S. stock market had a one-day settlement cycle was approximately 100 years ago.

The new "T+1" settlement cycle applies to listed stocks, bonds, municipal securities, exchange-traded funds, certain mutual funds, and exchange-traded limited partnerships. Under the new rules, if an investor sells stock on Monday, the trade will settle on Tuesday, meaning the securities officially transfer to the buyer's account and cash transfers to the seller's account one business day after the trade date.

The SEC notes that due to the shortened settlement cycle, there may be a risk of "short-term incremental" failed trades, and dealers will need to make adjustments. In rare cases, investors may need to deliver their securities certificates to their broker in advance or through alternative means, while investors buying securities may need to pay for the transaction one business day before the trade. This change may also affect certain terms in margin agreements, so investors should discuss with their brokers about specific changes that might affect their accounts.

The transition to "T+1" settlement is also occurring in other regions, including Canada and Mexico, implementing on the same day. This change is expected to align U.S. stock markets with modern information and communication technology, enabling faster settlement times.

**Important:** Note that the time between trading and settlement does not mean investors can back out of trades during this period. Trades are final on the trade date, only the transfer remains pending.

## T+1 Settlement Example

Suppose on Monday, June 3rd, an investor named Sarah decides to sell 100 shares of XYZ company stock at $50 per share. She places the order through her broker, and the trade is executed that day.

Under the "T+1" settlement cycle, the settlement date for this trade would be Tuesday, June 4th (assuming no holidays). This means:

If this trade were conducted under a "T+2" settlement cycle, the settlement date would be Wednesday, June 5th, so the transfer of securities and cash would occur two business days after the trade date, rather than one business day.

## History of US Stock Settlement Cycles

A century ago, stock settlements were T+1, but all operations were manual. With the rapid growth in stock trading interest and volume of shares, the need to simplify the settlement process increased. The SEC initially set a five-business-day standard settlement cycle (T+5) for most securities transactions to allow sufficient time for physical delivery of stock certificates and corresponding payments. This standard was revised to T+3 in 1993, shortening the prevailing settlement practice at the time. In 2017, the SEC shortened the standard settlement cycle from T+3 to T+2; and in 2024, from T+2 to T+1.

## Are there exceptions to the new "T+1" settlement cycle?

Yes, certain types of securities and transactions may be exempt from the "T+1" settlement cycle. For example, some primary offerings such as Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) may have different settlement timeframes, depending on the listing exchange's regulations. Additionally, certain fixed-income securities, such as U.S. Treasury securities and many money market instruments, have already been settling on a "T+1" or even "T+0" (same-day settlement) basis.

## What is Settlement Risk?

Settlement risk refers to the possibility that one or multiple parties fail to fulfill contractual terms within the agreed-upon timeframe. Settlement risk is a type of counterparty risk associated with default risk and timing differences between parties. Settlement risk is also known as delivery risk or Herstatt risk. The time period between trading and settlement is designed to reduce settlement risk by ensuring all parties obtain complete information and payments.

## Conclusion

The settlement period for securities trading, abbreviated as T+1, T+2, or T+3, etc., refers to the number of days after the trade date when the actual settlement occurs. As of 2024, the U.S. stock market has transitioned to a T+1 settlement cycle, meaning most stock trades now settle within one business day after the trade date. This change aims to reduce settlement risk and align with modern technology and practices. However, it should be noted that certain securities and transactions in various markets or regions may have different settlement periods.
