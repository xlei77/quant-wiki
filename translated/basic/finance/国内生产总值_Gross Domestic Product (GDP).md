## What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP)?

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) refers to the total monetary or market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period. As a broad measure of overall domestic production, it serves as a comprehensive scorecard of a country's economic health.

While GDP is typically calculated annually, it can also be measured quarterly. For example, in the United States, the government releases annualized GDP estimates for each fiscal quarter as well as for the calendar year. The various datasets included in this report are given in real terms, meaning the data is adjusted for price changes, thus excluding the effects of inflation.

### Main Content

- Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country during a specific period.
- GDP provides a snapshot of a country's economy, used to estimate economic size and its growth rate.
- GDP can be calculated in three ways: using expenditure, production, or income, and can be adjusted for inflation and population to provide deeper insights.
- Real GDP accounts for the effects of inflation, while nominal GDP does not.
- Despite its limitations, GDP is a key tool that guides policymakers, investors, and businesses in making strategic decisions.

## Understanding Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

The calculation of a country's GDP includes all private and public consumption, government expenditures, investments, private inventory increases, paid construction costs, and foreign trade balance. Exports add value, while imports subtract value.[1]

Among all components that constitute a country's GDP, the foreign trade balance is particularly important. A country's GDP tends to increase when the total value of goods and services sold by domestic producers to foreign countries exceeds the total value of foreign goods and services purchased by domestic consumers. When this occurs, a country is said to have a trade surplus.

If the opposite occurs—that is, if domestic consumers' spending on foreign products exceeds the total that domestic producers can sell to foreign consumers—it is called a trade deficit. In this case, a country's GDP tends to decrease.

GDP can be calculated in nominal or real terms, with the latter accounting for inflation. Overall, real GDP is a better method for expressing a country's long-term economic performance because it uses constant dollars.[2]

Suppose a country had a nominal GDP of $100 billion in 2012. By 2022, its nominal GDP grew to $150 billion. Prices also rose by 100% during the same period. In this example, if you only look at its nominal GDP, the country's economy appears to be performing well. However, the real GDP (expressed in 2012 dollars) is only $75 billion, indicating that actual economic performance actually experienced an overall decline during this period.

## What Can GDP Tell You?

A country's GDP represents the final market value of all goods and services produced within that country during a year. Another way to measure GDP is by adding four factors: consumer spending, government spending, net exports, and total investment.

In the United States, GDP is calculated quarterly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Bureau of Economic Analysis makes its estimates based on price estimates, survey data, and other information collected by other agencies such as the Census Bureau, Federal Reserve Board, Treasury Department, and Bureau of Labor Statistics.[3]

## Types of GDP

GDP can be reported in several ways, each providing slightly different information.

Nominal GDP is an assessment of economic production in an economy that includes current prices in its calculation. In other words, it does not remove the effects of inflation or the rate of price increases, which may inflate growth figures.

All goods and services calculated in nominal GDP are valued at the actual selling prices of these goods and services in that year. Nominal GDP is evaluated in local currency or US dollars at market exchange rates to compare GDPs across countries in purely financial terms.

Nominal GDP is used to compare output between different quarters within the same year. When comparing GDP across two or more years, real GDP is used. This is because, in effect, removing the impact of inflation allows comparisons between different years to focus entirely on quantity.

Real GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the quantity of goods and services produced by an economy in a given year, with prices remaining constant from year to year to separate the effect of inflation or deflation from trends in output over time. Since GDP is based on the monetary value of goods and services, it is subject to inflation.

Price increases tend to increase a country's GDP, but this doesn't necessarily reflect any changes in the quantity or quality of goods and services. Therefore, it's difficult to determine whether an increase in an economy's nominal GDP is due to actual expansion in production or merely due to price increases.

Economists use an inflation-adjustment process to derive an economy's real GDP. By adjusting any given year's output according to price levels in a reference year (called the base year), economists can adjust for the effects of inflation. This allows GDP comparisons across different years in a country to see if there has been any real growth.

Real GDP is calculated using the GDP deflator, which is the price difference between the current year and the base year. For example, if prices have risen 5% since the base year, the deflator would be 1.05. Nominal GDP divided by this deflator yields real GDP. Nominal GDP is typically higher than real GDP because inflation is usually positive.[2]

Real GDP takes into account changes in market value and thus narrows the gap between output figures from different years. If there is a large difference between a country's real and nominal GDP, this might indicate significant inflation or deflation in its economy.

GDP per capita is a measure of GDP per person in a country's population. It indicates the amount of output or income per person in an economy that can suggest average productivity or average living standards. GDP per capita can be expressed in nominal, real (inflation-adjusted), or Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) terms.[4]

From a basic explanation, GDP per capita shows the value of economic production that can be attributed to each citizen. This also translates into a measure of overall national wealth, as GDP per capita market value also serves readily as a measure of prosperity.

GDP per capita is typically analyzed alongside more traditional GDP measures. Economists use this metric to gain insight into their own country's domestic productivity and that of other countries. GDP per capita takes into account both a country's GDP and its population. Therefore, it's important to understand how each factor contributes to the overall result and influences per capita GDP growth.

For example, if a country's GDP per capita grows with stable population levels, this might result from technological advances that produce more with the same population level. Some countries might have high GDP per capita but small populations, which typically means they have established self-sufficient economies based on abundant special resources.

## GDP Growth Rate

GDP growth rate compares the year-over-year (or quarterly) change in a country's economic output to measure the pace of economic growth. Usually expressed as a percentage, this measure is popular among economic policymakers because GDP growth is considered to be closely related to key policy objectives such as inflation and unemployment rates.[5]

If GDP growth rate accelerates, this may indicate an overheating economy, and central banks might seek to raise interest rates. Conversely, central banks view a decline (or negative growth) in GDP growth rate (i.e., recession) as a signal that interest rates should be lowered and stimulus measures may be needed.

While not a direct measure of GDP, economists pay attention to PPP to understand how a country's GDP measures in international dollars, using a method that adjusts for local price and cost of living differences to enable cross-country comparisons of real output, real income, and living standards.[6]

**1.3%:** The annual GDP growth rate for the United States in the first quarter of 2024. U.S. GDP recorded 3.4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2023.[7]

## GDP Formula

GDP can be determined through three main methods. When calculated correctly, all three methods should produce the same number. These three methods are commonly known as the expenditure approach, output (or production) approach, and income approach.

The expenditure approach, also known as the consumption approach, calculates the spending of different groups participating in the economy. U.S. GDP is primarily measured using the expenditure approach. This method can be calculated using the following formula:

$$ \begin{aligned}&\text{GDP} = \text{C} + \text{G} + \text{I} + \text{NX} \\&\textbf{其中：} \\&\text{C} = \text{消费} \\&\text{G} = \text{政府支出} \\&\text{I} = \text{投资} \\&\text{NX} = \text{净出口} \\\end{aligned} $$

All these activities contribute to a country's GDP. Consumption refers to private consumption expenditure or consumer spending. Consumers spend money on goods and services, such as food and haircuts.[8] Consumer spending is the largest component of GDP, accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. GDP.[9]

Therefore, consumer confidence has a very important impact on economic growth. High confidence levels indicate consumers' willingness to spend, while low confidence levels reflect uncertainty about the future and reluctance to spend.

Government spending represents government consumption expenditure and gross investment. The government spends money on equipment, infrastructure, and wages. When consumer spending and business investment both drop sharply, government spending may become more important relative to other components of a country's GDP. (For example, this might occur following an economic recession.)

Investment refers to private domestic investment or capital expenditure. Businesses spend money investing in their business activities. For example, businesses might purchase machinery. Business investment is a key component of GDP as it increases the economy's productive capacity and raises employment levels.

The net exports formula subtracts total imports from total exports (NX = Exports - Imports). The goods and services produced by an economy and exported to other countries, minus imported goods purchased by domestic consumers, represent a country's net exports. All spending by companies located in a given country (even foreign companies) is included in this calculation.[8]

The production approach is essentially the reverse of the expenditure approach. Instead of measuring the input costs that contribute to economic activity, the production approach estimates the total value of economic output and deducts the cost of intermediate goods consumed in the process (such as materials and services). While the expenditure approach projects forward from costs, the production approach looks backward from the state of completed economic activity.[10]

The income approach represents a middle ground between the two other methods of calculating GDP. The income approach calculates all income earned by factors of production in the economy, including wages paid to labor, rent earned by land, returns to capital in the form of interest, and corporate profits.

The income approach considers adjustments for items that are not considered payments to factors of production. First, there are taxes, such as sales taxes and property taxes, which are classified as indirect business taxes.

Additionally, depreciation (a reserve that businesses set aside to replace equipment that wears out from use) is also added to national income. All of these together constitute national income.[11]

## GDP vs. GNP vs. GNI

While GDP is a widely used indicator, there are other ways to measure a country's economic growth. While GDP measures economic activity within a country's physical boundaries (regardless of whether the producers are local nationals or foreign-owned entities), Gross National Product (GNP) measures the overall production by a country's nationals or companies, including those located abroad. GNP excludes domestic production by foreigners.[12]

Gross National Income (GNI) is another indicator for measuring economic growth. It is the sum of all income earned by a country's citizens or nationals (regardless of whether the related economic activity occurs domestically or abroad).[13] The relationship between GNP and GNI is similar to the relationship between the production (output) and income approaches used to calculate GDP.

GNP uses the production approach, while GNI uses the income approach. For GNI, a country's income is calculated as its domestic income, plus its indirect business taxes and depreciation (along with its net foreign factor income). The net foreign factor income figure is calculated by subtracting all payments made to foreign companies and individuals from all payments made to domestic enterprises.

In an increasingly globalized economy, GNI has been proposed as a better measure of overall economic health than GDP. Since a significant portion of income in some countries is extracted abroad by foreign companies and individuals, their GDP figures are substantially higher than their GNI figures.

For example, in 2019, there was a significant difference between Luxembourg's GDP and GNI, primarily due to large payments made to the rest of the world through foreign companies operating in Luxembourg, attracted by the small country's favorable tax laws.[14] In contrast, there is no significant difference between the United States' GNI and GDP. As of the first quarter of 2024, U.S. GDP was $28.25 trillion, while its GNI as of the end of 2022 was approximately $25.98 trillion.[15][16]

## GDP Adjustments

A country's GDP can be adjusted in several ways to enhance its practical utility. For economists, a country's GDP reveals the size of the economy but provides little information about the standard of living in that country. This is partly because population sizes and living costs are not consistent worldwide. Economists can use the ratio of tax revenue to GDP to better understand how a country's tax revenue affects its economy and its people.

For example, comparing China's nominal GDP with Ireland's nominal GDP won't provide much meaningful information about the living realities in these countries, as China's population is approximately 300 times that of Ireland.[17]

To help address this issue, statisticians sometimes compare GDP per capita across countries. GDP per capita is calculated by dividing a country's total GDP by its population and is frequently cited to evaluate a country's standard of living. Nevertheless, this measure remains imperfect.

Suppose China's GDP per capita is $1,500, while Ireland's is $15,000. This doesn't necessarily mean that the average Irish person is 10 times better off than the average Chinese person. GDP per capita doesn't account for how expensive it is to live in a country.

PPP attempts to address this by comparing how much goods and services currency units adjusted for exchange rates can buy in different countries—effectively comparing the prices of an item or basket of items between two countries after adjusting for exchange rates between them.

Real GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power parity is a highly refined statistic used to measure real income, which is an important component of well-being. A person in Ireland might earn $100,000 per year, while a person in China might earn $50,000 per year. Nominally, the Irish worker is better off. However, if a year's worth of food, clothing, and other items costs three times as much in Ireland as in China, then the Chinese worker has a higher real income.

## How to Use GDP Data

Most countries/regions release GDP data monthly and quarterly. In the United States, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) releases a preliminary version of quarterly GDP four weeks after the quarter ends, and the final version three months after the quarter ends. The BEA's releases are comprehensive, containing extensive details that allow economists and investors to gain information and insights about various aspects of the economy.[18]

The market impact of GDP is usually limited because it is retrospective, and considerable time has passed between the quarter's end and the GDP data release. However, GDP data can affect markets if the actual figures differ significantly from expectations.

Since GDP directly indicates economic health and growth, businesses can use GDP as a guide for their business strategies. Government entities (such as the Federal Reserve in the United States) use growth rates and other GDP statistics as part of their decision-making process to determine what type of monetary policy to implement.

If growth rates slow, they may implement expansionary monetary policy to try to stimulate the economy. If growth rates are strong, they may use monetary policy to slow economic development in an attempt to avoid inflation.

Real GDP is the most telling indicator of economic health. It receives widespread attention and discussion from economists, analysts, investors, and policymakers. The preliminary release of the latest data almost always affects the market, although as mentioned above, this impact may be limited.

## GDP and Investment

Investors pay attention to GDP because it provides a framework for decision-making. Corporate profits and inventory data in GDP reports are important resources for stock investors, as both categories show total growth for the period; corporate profit data also shows pre-tax profits, operating cash flows, and breakdowns across all major sectors of the economy.

Comparing GDP growth rates between different countries can play a role in asset allocation, helping to decide whether to invest in rapidly growing foreign economies and, if so, which ones.

Investors can use an interesting indicator to understand stock market valuation: the ratio of total market capitalization to GDP, expressed as a percentage. In terms of stock valuation, the closest equivalent is the ratio of a company's market value to total sales (or revenue), which, calculated per share, is the well-known price-to-sales ratio.

Just as stocks in different industries trade at widely varying price-to-sales ratios, market cap-to-GDP ratios differ across countries. For example, according to World Bank data, the U.S. market cap-to-GDP ratio was 197.4% in 2020, while China's ratio was slightly above 83.6%, and Hong Kong's ratio was as high as 1,777.2%.[19]

However, this ratio's utility lies in comparing it to a particular country's historical norm. For instance, the U.S. market cap-to-GDP ratio was 141.6% at the end of 2006 and fell to 78.5% by the end of 2008.[19] In hindsight, these represented areas of significant overvaluation and undervaluation in the U.S. stock market.

The biggest drawback of this data is its lack of timeliness; investors can only get updates once per quarter, and revisions can be substantial enough to significantly alter the percentage changes in GDP.

## History of GDP

The concept of GDP was first proposed in a report submitted to the U.S. Congress in 1937 in response to the Great Depression, conceived and presented by Simon Kuznets, an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).[20]

At that time, the main measurement system was GNP. After the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, GDP was widely adopted as the standard means of measuring national economies; however, the United States continued to use GNP as its official measure of economic welfare until 1991, when it switched to GDP.[21]22

However, starting in the 1950s, some economists and policymakers began to question GDP. For example, some observed a tendency for people to view GDP as an absolute indicator of a country's failure or success, despite its failure to account for health, happiness, (in)equality, and other components of public welfare. In other words, these critics drew attention to the distinction between economic progress and social progress.

Most authorities, such as Arthur Okun, an economist on President John F. Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers, remained convinced that GDP was the absolute indicator of economic success, claiming that each increase in GDP corresponded to a proportional decrease in unemployment.[23]

## Criticisms of GDP

Of course, using GDP as an indicator also has its drawbacks. Besides lacking timeliness, other criticisms of GDP as a measurement standard include:

- It ignores the value of informal or unrecorded economic activities. GDP relies on recorded transactions and official data, thus failing to account for informal economic activities. GDP fails to consider the value of unreported employment, underground market activities, or unpaid volunteer work, which may be significant in some countries, and cannot account for the value of leisure time or household production, which are universal conditions of human life in all societies.
- It is geographically limited in globally open economies. GDP does not account for profits earned by foreign companies in a country that are repatriated to foreign investors. This may overstate a country's actual economic output. For example, in 2022, Ireland's GDP was $533.14 billion while its GNI was $382.87 billion, a difference of about $150.27 billion (or over 28% of GDP), primarily due to profit repatriation by foreign companies headquartered in Ireland.[24]25
- It emphasizes material output without considering overall well-being. As mentioned above, GDP growth alone cannot measure a country's development or its citizens' well-being. For instance, a country might experience rapid GDP growth, but this could come at significant societal costs, such as environmental impacts and widening income gaps.
- It ignores business-to-business activities. GDP only considers final goods production and new capital investment, deliberately excluding intermediate expenses and transactions between businesses. In doing so, GDP overstates the importance of consumption relative to production in the economy and is less sensitive as an indicator of economic fluctuations compared to measures that include business-to-business activities.
- It treats costs and waste as economic benefits. GDP counts all final private and government expenditures as increases in social income and output, regardless of whether they are productive or profitable. This means that obviously non-productive or even destructive activities are typically counted as economic output and contribute to GDP growth. For example, this includes expenditures used to extract or transfer wealth between members of society rather than produce wealth (such as administrative costs of taxation or funds used for lobbying and rent-seeking); spending on investment projects that lack necessary complementary goods and labor or real consumer demand (such as building ghost cities with no inhabitants or bridges to nowhere); and expenditures on goods and services that are themselves destructive or merely offset other destructive activities rather than create new wealth (such as production of weapons of war or spending on policing and anti-crime measures).

## Global Sources of National GDP Data

The World Bank has one of the most reliable web-based databases. It maintains one of the best and most comprehensive lists of countries/regions tracking GDP data. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also provides GDP data through its multiple databases, such as the World Economic Outlook and International Financial Statistics.[26]27

Another highly reliable source of GDP data is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD not only provides historical data but also forecasts GDP growth. The disadvantage of using the OECD database is that it only tracks OECD member countries and a few non-member countries.[28]

In the United States, the Federal Reserve collects data from multiple sources, including national statistical agencies and the World Bank. The only drawback to using the Federal Reserve database is that GDP data lacks updates and is missing data for certain countries/regions.[29]

The BEA is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce. It releases its own analytical documents with each GDP release, which serves as an excellent tool for investors to analyze data and trends, and read highlights from the very lengthy full release.[18]

## What is the simple definition of GDP?

Gross Domestic Product is a metric designed to measure a country's economic output. Countries with higher GDP produce more goods and services within their borders and typically have higher standards of living. As a result, many citizens and political leaders view GDP growth as an important criterion for measuring national success, often using GDP growth and economic growth interchangeably. However, due to various limitations, many economists believe that GDP should not be used as a measure of overall economic success, let alone as an indicator of social success.

## Which Country Has the Highest GDP?

The two countries with the highest GDP in the world are the United States and China. However, their ranking depends on how you measure GDP. Using nominal GDP, as of 2022, the United States ranks first at $25.44 trillion, while China stands at $17.96 trillion. [30]

Many economists believe that using GDP at Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a more accurate measure of national wealth. By this standard, China is the world leader with a PPP GDP of $31.77 trillion in 2022, followed by the United States at $25.44 trillion. [31]

## Is High GDP a Good Thing?

Most people believe that higher GDP is better because it is associated with more economic opportunities and higher material living standards. However, it's possible for a country to have a very high GDP while still not being an attractive place to live, so it's important to consider other metrics as well.

For example, a country might have a high GDP but low GDP per capita, indicating substantial wealth that is concentrated in the hands of very few people. One way to address this is to consider GDP alongside another indicator of economic development, such as the Human Development Index (HDI).[6]

## Bottom Line

In their groundbreaking textbook "Economics," Paul Samuelson and William Nordhaus succinctly summarized the importance of national accounts and GDP. They compared GDP's ability to provide an overall picture of economic conditions to a satellite in space that can survey the weather across an entire continent.[32]

GDP enables policymakers and central banks to judge whether the economy is contracting or expanding, whether it needs stimulus or restraint, and whether threats such as recession or inflation exist. Like any measure, GDP has its imperfections. Over recent decades, governments have created various subtle modifications in an attempt to improve GDP's accuracy and specificity. Since the concept's inception, methods for calculating GDP have continuously evolved to keep pace with the development of industry activity measurements and the emergence and consumption of new types of intangible assets.
