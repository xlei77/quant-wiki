## What is a Balance Sheet?

A balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time. The balance sheet provides the foundation for investors to calculate returns and evaluate a company's capital structure.

In simple terms, the balance sheet is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of what a company owns and owes, while also showing the amount invested by shareholders. The balance sheet can be used in conjunction with other important financial statements to conduct fundamental analysis or calculate financial ratios.

### Key Points

- The balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity.
- It is one of the three core financial statements used to evaluate a business.
- Provides a snapshot of a company's financial position (what it owns and owes) as of the publication date.
- The balance sheet follows an equation where assets equal the sum of liabilities plus shareholders' equity.
- Fundamental analysts use the balance sheet to calculate financial ratios.

## How the Balance Sheet Works

The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific moment but cannot independently reflect long-term trends. Therefore, balance sheets should be compared with statements from previous periods.

Investors can evaluate a company's financial health through various ratios derived from the balance sheet, including debt-to-equity ratio and acid-test ratio. The income statement and cash flow statement also provide valuable context for assessing the company's financial condition, along with notes or appendices in earnings reports that may relate to the balance sheet.

The balance sheet follows this accounting equation, with assets on the left side balancing with the sum of liabilities and shareholders' equity on the right:

This formula is intuitive. Companies must pay for everything they own (assets) with either borrowed money (taking on liabilities) or funding from investors (issuing shareholder equity).

For example, if a company takes out a five-year, $4,000 loan from a bank, its assets (specifically the cash account) will increase by $4,000, while its liabilities (specifically the long-term debt account) will also increase by $4,000, balancing both sides. If the company receives $8,000 from investors, its assets will increase by that amount, and shareholders' equity will increase correspondingly. All earnings that the company generates above expenses will go into the shareholders' equity account. These earnings will appear on the asset side as cash, investments, inventory, or other assets.

**Important Note:** Balance sheets should also be compared with those of other companies in the same industry, as different industries have unique financing practices.

## Special Considerations

As mentioned above, the balance sheet contains information about assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. Assets should always equal the sum of liabilities and shareholders' equity. This means that the balance sheet should always remain balanced, hence its name. If it's not balanced, there might be some issues, including inaccurate or misplaced data, inventory or exchange rate errors, or calculation mistakes.

Each category consists of several smaller accounts that provide detailed information about the company's specific financial situation. These accounts vary by industry, and the same terms may have different meanings under different business contexts. Companies may choose to use a common-size balance sheet format, which shows both percentages and numerical values. This type of report facilitates quick comparison between items.

Investors may encounter several common components.

## Components of the Balance Sheet

This section's accounts are listed from top to bottom by liquidity. This refers to how easily they can be converted into cash. They are divided into current assets, which can be converted to cash within one year, and non-current or long-term assets, which generally cannot be liquidated within a year.

The general order of current asset accounts is as follows:

- Cash and cash equivalents are the most liquid assets, potentially including treasury bills and short-term certificates of deposit, as well as hard currency.
- Marketable securities refer to liquid equity and debt securities in the market.
- Accounts Receivable (AR) refers to money owed to the company by customers. May include allowance for bad debts, as some customers might not pay what they owe.
- Inventory refers to any goods available for sale, valued at the lower of cost or market.
- Prepaid expenses represent the value of paid expenses, such as insurance, advertising contracts, or rent.

Long-term assets include:

- Long-term investments are securities that won't or cannot be liquidated in the next year.
- Fixed assets include land, machinery, equipment, buildings, and other durable, typically capital-intensive assets.
- Intangible assets include non-physical (but still valuable) assets such as intellectual property and goodwill. These assets typically only appear on the balance sheet through acquisition rather than internal development. Thus, their value may be greatly understated (e.g., globally recognized trademarks not included) or overstated.

Liabilities are any amounts the company owes to external parties, including bills that must be paid to suppliers, bond interest to creditors, rent, utilities, and wages. Current liabilities are due within one year, listed in order of due date. Long-term liabilities are due after one year.

Current liability accounts may include:

- Current portion of long-term debt refers to the portion of long-term debt due in the next 12 months. For example, if a company has a 10-year warehouse loan, 1 year is current liability, 9 years is long-term liability.
- Interest payable is accrued interest due, often due as part of past due obligations, such as property taxes not paid on time.
- Wages payable refers to wages, salaries, and benefits owed to employees, typically for the most recent pay period.
- Customer prepayments are funds received from customers before services are rendered or goods delivered. The company has an obligation to either (a) provide that good or service or (b) refund the customer's money.
- Dividends payable refers to dividends that have been declared but not yet paid.
- Premiums received and unearned are similar to prepayments, where the company has received money upfront but hasn't fulfilled its part of the agreement, which must be refunded if not executed.
- Accounts payable is typically the most common current liability. Accounts payable are debt obligations on invoices processed as part of business operations, typically due within 30 days of receipt.

Long-term liabilities may include:

- Long-term debt includes any interest and principal on bonds issued.
- Pension fund liabilities refer to money the company must pay into employee retirement accounts.
- Deferred tax liabilities refer to taxes that have accrued but won't be paid in the coming year. Beyond timing, this number reconciles differences between financial reporting requirements and how taxes are assessed, such as depreciation calculations.

Some liabilities are considered off-balance-sheet liabilities, meaning they don't appear on the balance sheet.

Shareholders' equity refers to funds belonging to the business owners or shareholders, also known as net assets because it equals total assets minus liabilities or its debts to non-shareholders.

Retained earnings are net income that the company reinvests in the business or uses to pay down debt. The remainder is distributed to shareholders as dividends.

Treasury stock refers to shares the company has repurchased, which can be resold in the future to raise cash if needed or held to defend against hostile takeovers.

Some companies issue preferred stock, which is shown separately in this section. Preferred stock is assigned an arbitrary par value (as is common stock in some cases), which is unrelated to the market value of the stock. Common and preferred stock accounts are calculated by multiplying par value by the number of shares issued.

Additional paid-in capital or capital surplus represents shareholder investment in excess of par value in common or preferred stock accounts, rather than based on market prices. Shareholders' equity is not directly related to a company's market value. The latter is based on current stock price, while paid-in capital is the sum of equity purchased at any price.

**Note:** Par value is typically just a very small amount, such as $0.01.

## Importance of the Balance Sheet

Regardless of a company's size or industry, there are many benefits to reading, analyzing, and understanding the balance sheet.

First, the balance sheet helps identify risks. This financial statement lists everything a company owns and all its debts. Companies can quickly assess whether they have borrowed too much, lack liquid assets, or have sufficient cash to meet current needs.

The balance sheet is also used to obtain capital. Companies typically must provide balance sheets to lenders to secure business loans. When seeking private equity financing, companies usually need to provide balance sheets to private investors as well. In both cases, external parties want to evaluate the company's financial health, creditworthiness, and ability to repay short-term debt.

Management can choose to use financial ratios to measure the company's liquidity, profitability, solvency, and turnover rates, some of which require data from the balance sheet. When considered over time or compared with competing companies, management can better understand how to improve the company's financial health.

Finally, the balance sheet helps attract and retain talent. Employees typically prefer to know their jobs are secure and that the company they work for is financially sound. For public companies that must disclose their balance sheets, this requirement allows employees to see how much cash the company has on hand, whether it makes wise decisions in managing debt, and whether the company's financial health meets their expectations.

## Limitations of the Balance Sheet

Although the balance sheet is indispensable information for investors and analysts, it has several limitations. Since the balance sheet is static, many financial ratios are based on data contained in both the balance sheet and the more dynamic income statement and cash flow statement to paint a more comprehensive picture of company operations. Therefore, the balance sheet alone may not fully reflect a company's financial health.

The limitation of the balance sheet lies in its narrow time scope. This financial statement only captures a company's financial position on a specific date. Looking at a single balance sheet in isolation can make it difficult to judge whether a company is performing well. For example, suppose a company reports a cash balance of $1 million at the end of the month. Without context, comparison points, understanding of its previous cash balances, and knowledge of industry operational requirements, merely knowing the amount of cash on hand has limited significance.

Different accounting systems and methods of handling depreciation and inventory can also alter the numbers reported on the balance sheet. Thus, management has some ability to manipulate the numbers to appear more favorable. Pay attention to the balance sheet footnotes to determine which accounting systems are used and watch for potential red flags.

Finally, the balance sheet is also affected by several areas of professional judgment that can materially impact reporting. For instance, accounts receivable must be continuously assessed for impairment and adjusted to reflect potential bad debts. When it's uncertain which receivables the company will actually collect, companies must make estimates and reflect their best guess on the balance sheet.

## Balance Sheet Example

The following figure shows a comparative balance sheet example for Apple Inc. The balance sheet compares the company's financial position as of September 2020 with that of the previous year.

In this example, Apple's total assets are $323.8 billion, with the assets section separated at the top of the report. The assets section is divided into current assets and non-current assets, which are further broken down into more specific accounts. A quick look at Apple's assets shows that its cash balance has decreased, while its non-current assets have increased.

The balance sheet also reports Apple's liabilities and shareholders' equity, each having separate sections in the lower half of the report. Similar to the assets section, the liabilities section is divided into current liabilities and non-current liabilities, with balances reported by account. The total shareholders' equity section reports the value of common stock, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income. Apple's total liabilities increased and total equity decreased, with the sum of these two matching the company's total assets.[1]

## Why is the Balance Sheet Important?

The balance sheet is an important tool used by executives, investors, analysts, and regulators to understand a company's current financial health. It is typically used in conjunction with two other financial statements: the income statement and the cash flow statement.

The balance sheet enables users to quickly examine a company's assets and liabilities. It helps answer questions such as whether the company has positive net assets, whether it has sufficient cash and short-term assets to cover its obligations, and whether the company is highly leveraged compared to its peers.

## What Does a Balance Sheet Contain?

A balance sheet contains information about a company's assets and liabilities. Depending on the company, this may include short-term assets such as cash and accounts receivable, or long-term assets such as property, plant and equipment (PP&E). Similarly, its liabilities may include short-term obligations such as accounts payable and wages payable, or long-term liabilities such as bank loans and other debt obligations.

## Who is Responsible for Preparing the Balance Sheet?

Depending on the company, different personnel may be responsible for preparing the balance sheet. For small private businesses, the balance sheet may be prepared by the owner or the company bookkeeper. For medium-sized private companies, the balance sheet may be prepared internally and then reviewed by external accountants.

On the other hand, public companies must undergo external audits by public accountants and ensure their books adhere to higher standards. The balance sheets and other financial statements of these companies must be prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and submitted regularly to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). [2]

## What is the Purpose of a Balance Sheet?

A balance sheet explains a company's financial position at a specific point in time. Unlike the income statement, which reports financial information over a period, the balance sheet is used to assess a company's health on a specific date.

Bank statements are frequently used by external parties to evaluate a company's health. Banks, lenders, and other institutions may use balances from the balance sheet to calculate financial ratios that measure the company's risk exposure, asset liquidity, and the likelihood of maintaining solvency.

Companies can use balance sheets to make internal decisions, though the information provided is typically not as helpful as the income statement. Companies might review their balance sheet to measure risk, ensure they have sufficient cash on hand, and evaluate how to raise more capital (through debt or equity).

## What is the Balance Sheet Formula?

In accounting, the ending balance is obtained by summing all debits and credits. The balance sheet, as an important financial tool, calculates a company's assets, liabilities, and equity. Total assets are calculated as the sum of all short-term, long-term, and other assets. Total liabilities are calculated as the sum of all short-term, long-term, and other liabilities. Total equity is calculated as the sum of net income, retained earnings, owner contributions, and issued stock. The formula is: Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Total Equity.
