## What is a Put Option?

A put option (or "put") is a contract that gives the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell (or short) a specified amount of the underlying security at a predetermined price within a specified time period. This predetermined price is called the strike price.

Put options can be traded on various underlying assets including stocks, currencies, bonds, commodities, futures, and indices. Put options contrast with call options, which give the holder the right to buy the underlying security at a specified price on or before the option's expiration date.

### Key Points

- A put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specified amount of the underlying security at a specified price within a specified time period.
- Put options are applicable to a wide range of asset classes, including stocks, indices, commodities, and currencies.
- The price of put options is influenced by factors such as changes in underlying asset price, strike price, time decay, interest rates, and volatility.
- The value of put options increases as the underlying asset price falls, volatility of the underlying asset increases, and interest rates decrease.
- The value of put options decreases as the underlying asset price rises, volatility of the underlying asset decreases, interest rates increase, and expiration date approaches.

## How Put Options Work

When the price of the underlying stock or security decreases, the value of a put option increases; conversely, when the underlying stock price rises, the value of the put option decreases. Therefore, put options are typically used to hedge against or speculate on downside risk.

Investors often use put options in a risk management strategy called a protective put, which is a form of investment insurance or hedge designed to ensure losses on the underlying asset don't exceed a certain amount. In this strategy, investors purchase put options to hedge against downside risk in their portfolio's stock positions. If the option is exercised, the investor will sell the stock at the put's strike price. If an investor exercises a put option without holding the underlying stock, it creates a short position in the stock.

Generally, the value of put options decreases as expiration approaches, primarily due to time decay. Time decay accelerates as the option nears expiration because there's less time to profit from trading. When options lose their time value, what remains is intrinsic value. An option's intrinsic value equals the difference between the strike price and the underlying stock price. If an option has intrinsic value, it's called "in-the-money" (ITM).

**Important Note:** Option's intrinsic value = The difference between the underlying security's market price and the option's strike price (for put options, intrinsic value = strike price minus underlying security's market price; for call options, intrinsic value = underlying security's market price minus strike price)

"Out-of-the-money" (OTM) and "at-the-money" (ATM) put options have no intrinsic value as there's no benefit to exercising the option. Investors can choose to short at the current higher market price rather than exercise an OTM put at an unfavorable strike price. However, shorting is usually riskier than buying put options in non-bear markets.

Time value or extrinsic value is reflected in the option's premium. If a put option has a strike price of $20 and the underlying stock currently trades at $19, the option's intrinsic value is $1. But that put option might trade at $1.35. The additional $0.35 is time value, as the underlying stock price could change before the option expires. Different put options can be combined to form put spreads.

There are several factors to keep in mind when selling put options. When considering a trade, it's crucial to understand the option contract's value and profitability, or you might risk the stock falling below your breakeven point.

The payoff for put options at expiration is shown in the following diagram:

## Where to Trade Options

Options trading, including selling options and many other types of options, is conducted through brokerage firms. Some brokers offer specialized features and benefits for options traders. For those interested in options trading, there are many brokers that specialize in options trading. It's important to choose a broker that matches your investment needs.

## Alternative Options for Exercising Put Options

Put option buyers do not need to hold the option until expiration. As the underlying stock price fluctuates, the option premium will change to reflect the latest movements in the underlying price. Option buyers can sell their options to minimize losses or realize profits based on price changes since their purchase.

Similarly, option sellers can do the same. If the underlying price is above the strike price, they may choose to take no action. This is because the option may expire worthless, allowing them to retain the full premium. However, if the underlying price is close to or below the strike price, option sellers may choose to buy back the option (thus exiting the position) to avoid substantial losses. The profit or loss is the difference between the premium received and the premium paid to buy back the position.

## Put Option Example

Suppose an investor buys a put option on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which trades at $445 in January 2022, with a strike price of $425 and one month until expiration. The option premium is $2.80, or $280 ($2.80 × 100 shares).

If SPY's unit price falls to $415 before expiration, the $425 put option will be "in-the-money" and trade for at least $10, which is the intrinsic value of the put option (i.e., $425 - $415). The specific price of the put option will depend on multiple factors, with time remaining until expiration being the most important. Let's assume the $425 put option trades at $10.50.

Since the put option is now "in-the-money," the investor must decide whether to (a) exercise the option, which gives them the right to sell 100 shares of SPY at the strike price of $425; or (b) sell the put option for a profit. We'll consider two scenarios: (i) the investor already owns 100 shares of SPY; (ii) the investor owns no SPY units. (The following calculations ignore commissions to simplify the illustration.)

Suppose the investor exercises the put option. If the investor already holds 100 units of SPY in their portfolio (assumed purchased at $400) and the put option was bought to hedge downside risk (i.e., this is a protective put), the investor's broker will sell 100 shares of SPY at the strike price of $425.

The net profit for this trade can be calculated as:

[(SPY selling price - SPY purchase price) - (put option purchase price)] × number of shares or units

Profit = [(425 - 400) - 2.80] × 100 = $2,220

If the investor doesn't own SPY units and bought the put option purely as a speculative trade, exercising the put option will result in shorting 100 shares of SPY at the strike price of $425. The investor can then buy back 100 shares of SPY at the current market price of $415 to close the position.

The net profit for this trade can be calculated as:

[(SPY short sale price - SPY purchase price) - (put option purchase price)] × number of shares or units

Profit = [(425 - 415) - 2.80] × 100 = $720

Exercising the option, (short) selling the stock and subsequently buying it back sounds like quite a bit of work, not to mention the additional costs of multiple transactions such as commissions and margin interest (shorting typically requires a margin account). However, the investor actually has a simpler "option": simply selling the put option at its current price for a substantial profit. In this case, the profit is calculated as:

[Put option selling price - put option purchase price] × number of shares or units = [10.50 - 2.80] × 100 = $770

Here's a key point to note. Selling the option rather than going through the relatively cumbersome exercise process actually results in a $770 profit, $50 more than the $720 gained by exercising. Why the difference? Because selling the option allows the $0.50 per share time value ($0.50 × 100 shares = $50) to be realized. Therefore, most long option positions that have value before expiration are sold rather than exercised.

For put option buyers, the maximum loss on the option position is limited to the premium paid. The maximum gain on the option position, if the underlying stock price falls to zero, would be as described above.

**Selling vs. Exercising Options**: Most long option positions are closed before expiration through selling rather than exercising because exercising results in loss of time value, higher transaction costs, and additional margin requirements.

## Writing Put Options

In the previous section, we discussed put options from the buyer's perspective, or investors holding long put positions. Now we'll focus on the other side of options trading: put option sellers or option writers who hold short put positions.

Contrary to long put options, short or written put options require investors to receive or purchase the underlying stock at the strike price specified in the options contract.

Suppose an investor is bullish on SPY, which currently trades at $445, and doesn't believe it will fall below $430 next month. The investor can write a put option with a $430 strike price and collect a premium of $3.45 per share (× 100 shares, totaling $345).

If SPY remains above the $430 strike price over the next month, the investor will keep the collected premium ($345) as the option will expire out-of-the-money and worthless. This is the maximum profit for this trade: $345, the premium collected.

Conversely, if SPY falls below $430 before the option expires in one month, the investor must purchase 100 shares at $430, even if SPY has dropped to $400, $350, or lower. Regardless of how far the stock falls, the put option writer must buy the stock at the $430 strike price, meaning they face a theoretical risk of $430 per share, or $43,000 per contract ($430 × 100 shares) if the underlying stock drops to zero.

For put option writers, the maximum gain is limited to the premium collected, while the maximum loss occurs when the underlying stock price falls to zero. The profit/loss characteristics for put option buyers and writers are therefore exactly opposite to each other.

## Are Buying Put Options Similar to Short Selling?

While both buying put options and short selling are bearish strategies, there are important differences between them. The maximum loss for a put option buyer is limited to the premium paid, and buying puts doesn't require a margin account and can be done with limited capital. In contrast, short selling carries theoretically unlimited risk and is significantly more expensive than buying put options due to costs like stock borrowing fees and margin interest. Therefore, short selling is considered riskier than buying put options.

## Should I Buy In-The-Money (ITM) or Out-of-The-Money (OTM) Put Options?

This really depends on factors such as your trading objectives, risk tolerance, and capital amount. In-The-Money (ITM) put options cost more in dollar terms than Out-of-The-Money (OTM) put options because they give you the right to sell the underlying security at a higher price. However, the lower cost of OTM put options is offset by their lower probability of profitability. If you don't want to spend too much on protective put options and are willing to accept moderate downside risk to your portfolio, then OTM put options might be a good choice.

## Will I Lose All the Premium Paid for the Put Option?

Yes, if the price of the underlying security is not below the strike price at option expiration, you may lose the entire premium paid for the put option.

## I'm new to options and have limited capital. Should I consider writing/selling options?

Selling options is an advanced options strategy suitable for experienced traders and investors; strategies such as cash-secured put options also require substantial capital. If you are new to options and have limited funds, writing/selling options would be a risky endeavor and is not recommended.

## Summary

A put option enables the holder to sell securities at a guaranteed price, even if the market price of the security has fallen. This makes it an effective tool for hedging strategies and speculative traders. Like call options, put options are one of the most fundamental derivative contracts.
