## What is Foreign Exchange (FX)?

Foreign Exchange (FX) refers to the global electronic market for international currency and currency derivatives trading. Although there is no physical location with a central entity, the forex market is the world's largest and most liquid market, with trillions of dollars exchanged daily. Most trading is conducted through banks, brokers, and financial institutions.

The forex market is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, except for holidays. Although many stock markets close during holidays, the forex market remains open, though trading volume may decrease.

The term "forex" is a combination of "foreign" and "exchange," commonly abbreviated as "fx."

### Key Points

- The foreign exchange market is a global electronic currency trading network.
- Previously, forex trading was limited to governments and financial institutions, but now individuals can also buy and sell currencies directly in the forex market.
- In the forex market, profits or losses come from the price differences between buying and selling currency pairs.
- Forex traders do not deal with physical cash transactions. Brokers typically roll over their positions at the end of each day.

## Understanding Foreign Exchange (FX)

Foreign exchange traders use various analytical techniques to find optimal entry and exit points for trades. Foreign exchange exists to enable large amounts of one currency to be exchanged for equivalent amounts of another currency at current market rates.

Some trading occurs because financial institutions, companies, or individuals need to convert one currency into another. For example, a U.S. company might trade U.S. dollars for Japanese yen to pay for goods ordered from Japan that must be paid for in yen.

A large volume of foreign exchange trading is speculative, betting on the direction of currency values. Traders profit from price movements in specific currency pairs.

Currencies are listed in pairs, such as USD/CAD, EUR/USD, or USD/JPY. These represent relationships between U.S. Dollar (USD) and Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR) and U.S. Dollar (USD), and U.S. Dollar (USD) and Japanese Yen (JPY).

Each currency pair has a price quote, such as 1.2569. If this price relates to the USD/CAD currency pair, it means it takes 1.2569 Canadian dollars to buy one U.S. dollar. If the price moves to 1.3336, it now takes 1.3336 Canadian dollars to buy one U.S. dollar. This indicates the U.S. dollar has strengthened (Canadian dollar has weakened) because it takes more Canadian dollars to buy one U.S. dollar.

In the forex market, currencies are traded in contract units called micro, mini, and standard lots. Micro lots are 1,000 units of currency, mini lots are 10,000 units, and standard lots are 100,000 units.

Obviously, these trading sizes are much larger than exchanging $500 at a bank for travel. In the electronic forex market, trading occurs in currency blocks, and any number of trades can be made within the limits of your trading account balance. For example, you could trade seven micro lots (7,000) or three mini lots (30,000), or 75 standard lots (7,500,000).

The forex market has several unique characteristics, with size being the most significant. Daily trading volume exceeds $5 trillion, compared to about $200 billion in the stock market.

The largest forex markets are located in major financial centers worldwide, including London, New York, Singapore, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, and Sydney.

The forex market is open 24 hours a day within major financial centers worldwide, meaning you can buy and sell currencies at almost any time.

Historically, forex trading was limited to governments, large corporations, and hedge funds. Now, anyone can trade forex. Many investment firms, banks, and retail brokers allow individuals to open accounts and trade currencies.

When trading in the forex market, you're buying or selling the currency of a particular country, relative to another currency. However, there's no actual currency moving from one party to another like at a currency exchange booth.

In the electronic market, traders typically hold positions in specific currencies, hoping the currency they bought will increase in value (or decrease if they sold) to make a profit.

Currency trading is always done against another currency. If you sell one currency, you're effectively buying another; if you buy one currency, you're selling another. Profits come from the difference between trading prices.

Spot market trades are for immediate delivery, with most currency pairs defined as having a two-business-day delivery time. The main exception is USD/CAD trading, which settles in one business day.

Business days exclude Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays in either currency of the pair. During Christmas and Easter, some spot trades may take up to six days to settle. Funds are exchanged on the settlement date rather than the trade date.

The U.S. dollar is the most actively traded currency, with the euro being the active counter currency, followed by the yen, British pound, and Chinese yuan.

Market volatility is driven by a combination of speculation, economic strength and growth, and interest rate differentials.

Retail traders typically don't want to hold the currencies they buy. They're only interested in profiting from price differences. Therefore, most retail brokers automatically roll over their currency positions at 5 PM Eastern time daily.

Brokers essentially reset positions and provide interest debits or credits based on the interest rate differential between the currency pair held. Trading continues without the need for delivery or settlement of trades.

When trades are closed, traders realize profits or losses based on the original trade price and the price when the trade is closed. Rollover interest credits or debits may add to or subtract from this return.

Since the forex market is closed on Saturdays and Sundays, interest rate credits or debits for these days are adjusted on Wednesday. Therefore, holding a position at 5 PM on Wednesday will result in triple the usual credit or debit amount.

Any forex trade that settles after spot is considered a forward trade. Prices are calculated by adjusting the spot rate to account for the interest rate differential between the two currencies. The adjustment amount is called "forward points."

Forward points only reflect the interest rate differential between two markets and are not a prediction of where the spot market will trade on a future date.

Forward contracts are customized and can be for any amount and settle on any non-weekend or non-holiday date. Like spot trades, funds are exchanged on the settlement date.

A foreign exchange or currency futures contract is an agreement between two parties to deliver a set amount of currency on a specific future date, called the expiration date. Futures contracts trade on exchanges with set currency values and expiration dates.

Unlike forward contracts, futures contract terms are non-negotiable. Profits come from the difference between prices when contracts are bought and sold.

Most speculators don't hold futures contracts until expiration, as this would require them to deliver or settle the currency represented by the contract. Instead, speculators buy and sell contracts before expiration, realizing their profits or losses.

## How Forex Differs from Other Markets

The foreign exchange market operates quite differently from other markets such as the U.S. stock market.

This means traders are not subject to the strict standards or regulations found in stock, futures, or options markets. The forex market has no clearinghouse and no central body regulating the entire market. You can sell short at any time because you're never actually shorting in the forex market; when you sell one currency, you're buying another.

Since the market is unregulated, commissions and fees vary widely between brokers. Most forex brokers make their money by marking up the spread on currency pairs, while others profit through commissions that fluctuate based on the currency amount traded. Some brokers use both methods.

There are no cutoff times restricting when you can and cannot trade. Since the market is open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, you can trade during any time period. Exceptions are weekends or when no global financial centers are open due to holidays.

The forex market allows leverage levels of up to 1:50 in the United States, and even higher in some parts of the world. This means traders can buy and sell up to $50,000 worth of currency with a $1,000 account. Leverage is a double-edged sword, amplifying both profits and losses.

## Forex Trading Example

Suppose a trader believes the Euro will appreciate against the US dollar. In other words, the US dollar will depreciate against the Euro.

The trader buys EUR/USD at 1.2500, purchasing currency worth $5,000. Later that day, the price rises to 1.2550. The trader makes a profit of $25 (5000 * 0.0050). If the price falls to 1.2430, the trader will lose $35 (5000 * 0.0070).

Currency prices fluctuate constantly, so the trader may decide to hold the position overnight. The broker will roll over the position, resulting in either a credit or debit based on the interest rate differential between the Eurozone and the United States.

If the Eurozone interest rate is 4% and the US rate is 3%, in this example, the trader holds the currency with the higher interest rate. Therefore, during rollover, the trader should receive a small credit. If the Euro interest rate is lower than the US rate, the trader will be debited during rollover.

Rollover can influence trading decisions, especially if trades can be held long-term. Large interest rate differentials can result in daily credits or debits, which can significantly enhance or reduce the trade's profit (or increase or decrease losses).

Most brokers offer leverage. Many US brokers offer leverage up to 1:50. Assume our trader uses 1:10 leverage in this trade. With 10:1 leverage, the trader doesn't need $5,000 in their account despite trading $5,000 worth of currency. Only $500 is required.

In this example, considering that the trader only needs $500 or $250 in trading capital (even with higher leverage) to potentially make a $25 profit quickly, this demonstrates the power of leverage. Conversely, the trader can also lose capital just as rapidly.

## Is Forex Trading Suitable for Beginners?

Forex trading can be high-risk and complex, requiring quick decision-making due to rapid exchange rate fluctuations. Therefore, forex trading may not be suitable for beginners; however, traders can learn forex trading through demo accounts or with low capital levels.

## How Much Money Do You Need to Start Forex Trading?

You can start forex trading with approximately $100. This is enough to begin buying and selling currencies. It's also a good level for beginners since it's not a large amount of capital to risk.

## What are the risks of forex trading?

Forex trading involves numerous risks. Exchange rates are highly volatile and change frequently, which can rapidly impact trades. Additionally, forex trading involves significant leverage, where even small fluctuations can lead to substantial losses. There are also counterparty risks, interest rate risks, and global or country-specific risks.

## Conclusion

Forex is the abbreviation for foreign exchange, referring to the global trading of currencies and currency derivatives. It is the world's largest financial market, involving the buying and selling of currency pairs by taking advantage of exchange rate fluctuations.
