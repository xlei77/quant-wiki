## What is NASDAQ?

NASDAQ is a global electronic securities trading market. Its name was originally an acronym for "National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations." NASDAQ was initially a subsidiary of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), which is now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

NASDAQ was established after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) urged NASD to automate the market for securities not listed on exchanges. The result was the first electronic trading system. NASDAQ began operations in 1971.[1]

### Key Points

- NASDAQ is an online global securities trading market and the world's first electronic exchange.
- It operates 29 markets, one clearinghouse, and five central securities depositories across the United States and Europe.
- Most of the world's major technology companies are listed on NASDAQ.

## Understanding NASDAQ

As mentioned above, NASDAQ is a stock exchange headquartered in New York. It was originally a subsidiary of NASD and officially began operations on February 8, 1971. It was the world's first automated stock exchange.[1]

NASDAQ officially separated from NASD in 2006 and began operating as a national securities exchange. In 2008, it merged with the Scandinavian exchange group OMX to become NASDAQ OMX Group.[2] The company was renamed to Nasdaq, Inc. in 2015.[3]

More than 5,000 companies are listed and traded on the exchange daily. Many of these companies are major technology companies, such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).

Since 2006, NASDAQ has consisted of three tiers: The NASDAQ Global Select Market, The NASDAQ Global Market, and The NASDAQ Capital Market.[4]

The exchange operates 29 markets, supporting trading in stocks, derivatives, fixed income, and commodities across the United States, Canada, Scandinavia, and the Baltic region. The company also operates a clearinghouse and five central securities depositories in the United States and Europe.[5] Its trading technology is used by 100 exchanges in 50 countries.

## NASDAQ Composite Index

The term "NASDAQ" is also used to refer to the NASDAQ Composite Index. This is an index that includes more than 2,500 stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange. The index includes several major technology giants, such as:

- Apple (AAPL)
- Microsoft (MSFT)
- Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)
- Meta Platforms (META)
- Amazon (AMZN)
- Tesla (TSLA)

The NASDAQ Composite Index reached its historical high of 16,057.44 on November 19, 2021. From that point, the index fell more than 23% through April 2022. [7] The NASDAQ Composite dropped 13.3% in April 2022, marking its worst monthly decline since October 2008, when it fell 17.4% during the global financial crisis. It closed at 13,787.92 on June 30, 2023. [8]

**Important Note:** The Nasdaq company is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol NDAQ and has been a component of the S&P 500 index since 2008.

## NASDAQ Trading System

The NASDAQ computerized trading system was originally designed as an alternative to the inefficient market maker system, which had been the dominant model for nearly a century. Rapid technological advancement has made NASDAQ's electronic trading model the standard for global markets.

For emerging technology companies worldwide, it was natural to list on an exchange that utilized the latest technology. As the technology sector became increasingly prominent during the 1980s and 1990s, the NASDAQ Composite Index became its most widely cited representative.

This made the NASDAQ Composite Index the barometer of boom and bust during the dot-com bubble. After rising nearly 150% in the 16 months leading up to March 2000, the NASDAQ Composite subsequently plunged almost 80% before October 2002.

## NASDAQ's History

In November 2016, Chief Operating Officer (COO) Adena Friedman was promoted to Chief Executive Officer (CEO), becoming the first woman to run a major U.S. exchange.[9]

On December 1, 2020, NASDAQ proposed a new rule requiring companies listed on the exchange to report on their board diversity. The rule requires companies to include at least one female director and one director from an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ+ community on their boards, or publicly explain why they have not done so. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the board diversity disclosure rule on August 6, 2021.[10]11

NASDAQ's revenue comes from clients including financial institutions, brokers, institutional investors, and corporations. NASDAQ's revenue primarily derives from the following fees:

- Market Services, enabling investors to access various markets
- Investment Intelligence, including data, indices, and investment analytics for financial institutions, brokers, and asset management firms
- Market Technology, including trading and clearing platforms and technological safeguards against financial crime
- Corporate Services, such as listing fees and investor relations services

NASDAQ reported total revenue of $6.23 billion and net income of $1.[12] billion for fiscal year 2022, ending December 31, 2022. Revenue less transaction-based expenses was $3.58 billion. The company also increased its quarterly dividend per share of common stock to $0.78 in 2022 from $0.70 in 2021.[12]
