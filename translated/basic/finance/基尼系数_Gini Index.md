## What is the Gini Coefficient?

The Gini coefficient measures a country's income inequality by examining the distribution of income or wealth across its population. The Gini coefficient was proposed by Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912.[1]2

The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 (or 0%) to 1 (or 100%), where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality.[2]

According to World Bank data, South Africa has the world's highest level of income inequality with a Gini coefficient of 63.0%. Norway has the lowest income inequality at 22.7%. The United States has an income inequality level of 39.8%.[3]

### Key Points

- The Gini coefficient is a measure of income distribution across a population.
- A higher Gini coefficient indicates a higher degree of inequality, where high-income groups receive a larger percentage of the national total income.
- Global inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) has steadily increased over the past centuries and peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The limitations of the Gini coefficient may exaggerate income inequality and potentially mask important information about income distribution.

## Understanding the Gini Index

If all residents in a country have the same income, that country's income Gini coefficient would be 0. If one resident in a country earns all the income while everyone else has no income, that country's income Gini coefficient would be 1.

The same analysis applies to wealth distribution (wealth Gini coefficient), but since wealth is more difficult to measure than income, the Gini coefficient typically refers to income and is usually reported simply as the Gini coefficient or Gini index without specifying that it refers to income. Wealth Gini coefficients tend to be much higher than income Gini coefficients.

Even in wealthy countries, the Gini index measures net income rather than net assets, so a country's wealth may be concentrated in the hands of a few even if income distribution is relatively equal.

The Gini coefficient is an important tool for analyzing income or wealth distribution within a country or region, but it should not be mistaken for an absolute measure of income or wealth.

A high-income country and a low-income country can have the same Gini coefficient as long as the income distribution within each country is similar. For example, according to Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data, Turkey and the United States have almost identical Gini coefficients, despite Turkey having a much lower GDP per capita than the United States.[4]5

## Graphical Representation of the Gini Index

The Gini index is typically represented graphically through the Lorenz curve, as shown in the figure below, which displays income (or wealth) distribution by plotting population percentiles by income on the horizontal axis and cumulative income on the vertical axis. The Gini coefficient equals the area below the line of perfect equality (defined as 0.5) minus the area below the Lorenz curve, divided by the area below the line of perfect equality. In other words, it is twice the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect equality.[2]6

## Global Gini Index

During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Gini coefficient showed continuous growth in global inequality.

In 1820, the global Gini coefficient was 0.50, while in 1980 and 1992, this figure was 0.657.

The latest estimates from the World Inequality Lab in 2020 show that the global Gini coefficient is 0.67.[7]8

COVID-19 has had further negative impacts on income equality. According to World Bank data, the Gini coefficient increased by approximately 1.5 percentage points in the five years following major epidemics such as Ebola and Zika. Economists believe that COVID-19 led to a 0.5 percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient from 2019 to 2020, marking the largest single-year increase in global inequality since World War II.[8]9

The following income Gini coefficient data for each country is provided by the CIA World Factbook:

Some of the world's poorest countries have the highest Gini coefficients, while many of the lowest Gini coefficients are found in wealthier European countries. However, the relationship between income inequality and GDP per capita is not entirely negative, and this relationship changes over time.[10]

Michail Moatsos of Utrecht University and Joery Baten of the University of Tübingen demonstrate that from 1820 to 1929, inequality rose slightly with increasing GDP per capita, then gradually decreased. From 1950 to 1970, inequality tended to decline as GDP per capita exceeded certain thresholds. From 1980 to 2000, inequality decreased with rising GDP per capita before sharply rebounding.[11]

## Limitations of the Gini Index

Although the Gini coefficient is useful for analyzing economic inequality, it has several drawbacks.

The accuracy of this indicator depends on reliable GDP and income data. Shadow economies and informal economic activities exist in every country.

In developing countries and at the lower end of income distributions across countries, informal economic activities tend to represent a larger proportion of real economic output. In both cases, this means that Gini coefficients measuring income will overstate the true degree of income inequality.

Due to the prevalence of tax havens, accurate wealth data is even harder to obtain as it becomes difficult to determine the amount of funds held by wealthy individuals.

Another flaw is that very different income distributions can result in the same Gini coefficient. Since the Gini coefficient attempts to distill a two-dimensional area (the gap between the Lorenz curve and the line of equality) into a single number, it obscures information about the shape of inequality.

In layman's terms, this is similar to describing the contents of a photograph using only the length along one edge or the simple average brightness value of its pixels.

While using the Lorenz curve as a supplement can provide more information in this regard, it also doesn't show demographic variations between subgroups within the distribution, such as income distribution across age, racial, or social groups.

In this sense, understanding demographic data is crucial for interpreting what a given Gini coefficient represents. For example, a large retired population will push the Gini coefficient higher.

## Which Country Has the Highest Gini Coefficient?

South Africa has a Gini coefficient of 63.0%, currently considered the country with the highest level of income inequality.

World Population Review attributes this massive inequality to discrimination based on race, gender, and geography, with white males and urban workers earning significantly more than all others.[8]

## What Does a Gini Index of 50 Mean?

The Gini index ranges from 0% to 100%, where 0 represents perfect equality and 100 represents perfect inequality. A country with a Gini index of 50 marks the midpoint and can be considered a country with significant income inequality.

As of 2024, only 14 countries in the world have a Gini index of 50 or higher.[12]

## Is the Gini Coefficient in the United States High or Low?

According to World Bank data, the United States' Gini coefficient is estimated at 39.8. This is a high reading for developed economies.

Economists attribute the increasing income inequality in the United States to factors such as technological change, globalization, the decline of labor unions, and the decreasing value of minimum wages.[12]13

## Bottom Line

If the wealth gap continues to widen, assessing income disparities may become increasingly important. The Gini coefficient can provide a good starting point for measuring income inequality.

Understanding that the Gini coefficient number is not a panacea, but it can quantify and track the direction of society's development, thereby opening doors for dialogue and potential solutions.

However, remember that there are limitations to using this measure. The reliability of the coefficient depends solely on the data used to calculate it, and a single numerical reading cannot tell the complete story.
