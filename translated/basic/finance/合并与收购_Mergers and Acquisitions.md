## What is Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)?

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) refers to a way companies combine. Entire companies or their major business assets are integrated through financial transactions between two or more companies. Companies can:

- Completely acquire and absorb another company
- Merge with it to create a new company
- Acquire some or all of its major assets
- Launch a tender offer for its stock
- Conduct a hostile takeover

All these methods of mergers or asset integration fall under M&A activities. The term M&A is also used to describe departments within financial institutions that facilitate or manage such activities.

### Key Points

- Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) refers to the consolidation or combination of companies or their assets.
- In an acquisition, one company completely purchases another company.
- A merger refers to two companies joining to form a new legal entity, operating under a single corporate name.
- Mergers and acquisitions require valuation of companies or their assets to determine how much value should be paid.
- M&A can be financed through a combination of debt, cash, and stock.

## Understanding the Differences Between Mergers and Acquisitions

The terms merger and acquisition are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings.

When one company takes complete control of another company and establishes itself as the new owner, this purchase is called an acquisition. Hostile takeovers, where the target company is unwilling to be acquired, are always considered acquisitions. However, acquisitions can also occur with both parties' willing participation.

On the other hand, a merger refers to when two companies join forces to move forward as a single new entity, rather than remaining separately owned. Generally, this occurs between companies of similar size and is known as a merger of equals.

For example, when Daimler-Benz merged with Chrysler, both independent companies ceased to exist, and a new company, DaimlerChrysler, was formed. The stocks of both companies were surrendered, and new company stock was issued. In a brand update, the company was renamed to Mercedes-Benz Group AG (MBG) in February 2022.

**Note:** Purchase deals may also be called mergers when both CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both companies.

Deals can be classified as either mergers or acquisitions based on whether the acquisition is friendly or hostile and how it is announced. In other words, the difference lies in how the transaction is communicated to the target company's board of directors, employees, and shareholders.

**Important:** M&A transactions generate substantial profits for the investment banking industry, but not all merger or acquisition deals successfully close.

## Types of Mergers and Acquisitions

Below are some common transactions that fall under the M&A category.

In a merger, the boards of directors of both companies approve the merger and seek shareholder consent. This type of M&A activity aims to enhance both brands, combining their respective strengths into the new company and creating greater market share for the newly formed entity.

For example, in 2024, HBC announced the acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group and its merger with its subsidiary Saks Fifth Avenue. Both Neiman Marcus Group (NMG) and Saks are luxury retailers, but their retail sales share has been declining with the rise of online shopping and decrease in brick-and-mortar retail. The merger will consolidate the existing three brands (Saks, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman) into one luxury retail brand called Saks Global. This integration aims to make it easier to compete with online retail giants.

In a simple acquisition, the acquiring company obtains controlling interest in the acquired company without changing its name or organizational structure. In some cases, the target company may require the buyer to commit to maintaining profitability of the acquired business for a certain period after acquisition, typically achieved through clean-room resolutions. Acquisitions typically allow the acquiring company to enter a new or related industry by leveraging the acquired company's existing customer base and services to expand its product line.

Amazon's 2017 acquisition of Whole Foods is an example of such a transaction. This acquisition allowed Amazon to expand into grocery delivery services (groceries being a major part of many people's budgets) and enter the health-conscious customer market. Whole Foods was struggling with market share as consumers found similar products at lower prices in other supermarkets, while benefiting from Amazon's extensive customer base and convenient consumer connections.

Corporate consolidation occurs when two or more companies merge to increase market share and eliminate competition. For example, Facebook consolidated its dominance in social media by acquiring other social media companies with promising business models that could potentially compete with it. One example is its $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012. Instagram continues to operate as an independent company under its parent company Facebook (now Meta Platforms). However, other acquisitions under Facebook led to acquired social media companies being integrated into the Facebook platform. For instance, social messaging service Beluga was acquired by Facebook and rebranded as Facebook Messenger.

In a tender offer, one company offers to purchase another company's outstanding stock at a specific price rather than the market price. The acquiring company communicates this proposal directly to the target company's shareholders, bypassing management and the board of directors. For example, in 2008, Johnson & Johnson made a tender offer to acquire Omrix Biopharmaceuticals for $438 million. The company accepted the offer, and the deal was completed by the end of 2008.

In an asset acquisition, one company directly purchases another company's assets. The acquired company's assets must be approved by shareholders. Asset acquisitions are particularly common in bankruptcy proceedings, where other companies bid on various assets of the bankrupt company, ultimately liquidating when assets transfer to the acquirer.

Management buyouts, also known as management-led buyouts (MBO), occur when a company's executives purchase controlling interest in another company to take it private. These former executives typically work with financiers or former company officials to help fund the transaction. These types of M&A transactions are usually financed through disproportionate debt financing, and most shareholders must approve the transaction. For example, in 2022, Tesla CEO Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion, taking the company private. The transaction included $25.5 billion in margin loans and debt financing.

## Merger Structures

Mergers can be structured in different ways based on the relationship between the two companies involved in the transaction:

- Horizontal merger: Two direct competitors sharing the same product lines and markets
- Vertical merger: Customer-company or supplier-company relationships, such as a merger between an ice cream manufacturer and a cone supplier
- Congeneric merger: Two businesses serving the same consumer base but in different ways, such as a TV manufacturer and a cable TV company
- Market extension merger: Two companies selling the same products in different markets
- Product extension merger: Two companies selling different but related products in the same market
- Conglomerate merger: Two companies with no common business areas

Mergers can also be distinguished based on two types of financing methods, each having different implications for investors.

As the name suggests, this type of merger occurs when one company acquires another. The purchase can be made through cash payment or by issuing some form of debt instrument. The sale is taxable, which appeals to the acquiring company due to tax benefits. Acquired assets can be recorded at the actual purchase price, and the difference between the book value and purchase price can be depreciated annually, thereby reducing the acquiring company's taxable amount.

In this type of merger, a completely new company is established, and both companies are acquired and merged under the new entity. The tax provisions are the same as in a purchase merger.

## Vertical and Horizontal Acquisitions

Horizontal integration and vertical integration are competitive strategies used by companies to strengthen their position among competitors. Horizontal integration refers to the acquisition of related businesses. Companies choosing horizontal integration will acquire a company operating at the same value chain level within the industry, such as Marriott International's acquisition of Sheraton Hotels and Resorts.

Vertical integration refers to the process of acquiring businesses within the same production chain. Companies choosing vertical integration will take complete control of one or more stages in a product's production or distribution. For example, Apple acquired AuthenTec, which manufactures Touch ID fingerprint sensor technology used in their iPhones.

## Acquisition Financing Methods

Companies can acquire another company through cash, stock, debt assumption, or a combination of the three. Sometimes, investment banks involved in the sale of a company may provide financing to the acquiring company, known as stapled financing, with the aim of generating larger and timely offers.

In smaller transactions, it's also common for one company to purchase all assets of another company. Company X buys all assets of Company Y with cash, meaning Company Y will be left with only cash (and any debt). Naturally, Company Y will eventually become a shell company and may enter other business areas.

Another type of acquisition transaction known as reverse merger allows a company to become publicly listed in a relatively short time. A reverse merger occurs when a private company with strong prospects, eager to obtain financing, acquires a listed shell company with no legitimate business operations and limited assets. The private company reverse merges into the public company, thereby combining into a new public company with tradable shares.

## How to Value Mergers and Acquisitions

In M&A transactions, both parties often have different valuations for the target company. The seller naturally hopes to value at the highest possible price, while the buyer attempts to acquire at the lowest possible price. Fortunately, by studying comparable companies in the industry, businesses can conduct objective valuations using the following metrics.

Using the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, the acquiring company can make an offer based on a multiple of the target company's earnings. Looking at P/E ratios of all stocks in the same industry will provide good guidance for the acquiring company regarding what P/E multiple the target company should have.

With the Enterprise Value-to-Sales ratio (EV/sales), the acquiring company can make an offer based on a multiple of the target company's revenue, while paying attention to the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of other companies in the industry.

As a key valuation tool in M&A, Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis can estimate a company's current value based on its future cash flows. Projected free cash flows (net income + depreciation/amortization + changes in working capital) are discounted to present value using the company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). Without doubt, proper use of DCF is complex, but few other tools can rival this valuation method.

In rare cases, acquisitions are made based on the replacement cost of the target company. For simplicity, one can assume a company is worth simply the sum of all its equipment and personnel costs. The acquiring company can either directly request the target company to sell at this price, or it will create a competitor at the same cost.

Of course, building a good management team, acquiring assets, and purchasing suitable equipment often takes considerable time. This pricing method is obviously less applicable in the service industry, as key assets such as personnel and ideas are difficult to evaluate and develop.

## Impact on Shareholders

Generally, in the days leading up to a merger or acquisition, shareholders of the acquiring company will see a temporary decline in their stock value. Meanwhile, the target company's stock typically increases in value. This is often because the acquiring company needs to purchase the target company at a premium above its pre-acquisition stock price.

After the merger or acquisition officially takes effect, stock prices typically exceed the pre-acquisition value of each public company. In the absence of adverse economic conditions, shareholders of the merged company usually experience good long-term performance and dividends.

Due to the issuance of additional shares during the merger process, shareholders of both companies may experience dilution of their voting rights. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in stock-for-stock mergers, where the new company exchanges its shares for the target company's shares at an agreed conversion ratio. Shareholders of the acquiring company experience a slight loss of voting power, while shareholders of the smaller target company may experience significant voting dilution within the larger shareholder base.

## What's the Difference Between Mergers and Acquisitions?

Generally, the term "acquisition" describes a transaction where one company absorbs another through purchase. The term "merger" is used to describe situations where the purchasing company and the target company combine to form an entirely new entity. Since each merger has its unique characteristics and reasons for conducting the transaction, the usage of these terms often overlaps.

## Why Do Companies Acquire Other Companies?

Competition and growth are two main driving forces of capitalism. When a company faces competition, it must both reduce costs and innovate. One solution is to acquire competitors, eliminating them as threats. Companies also achieve growth by acquiring new product lines, intellectual property, human capital, and customer bases. Through the integration of business activities, overall operational efficiency often improves, and companies' costs are reduced by leveraging each other's strengths.

## What is a Hostile Takeover?

Friendly acquisitions are most common, occurring when the target company agrees to be acquired; its board of directors and shareholders approve the acquisition, and such mergers typically serve the mutual interests of both the acquiring company and the target company.

Unfriendly acquisitions, commonly known as hostile takeovers, occur when the target company does not agree to be acquired. Since hostile takeovers fail to obtain the target company's consent, the acquiring company must actively purchase a majority of the target company's shares to gain controlling interest, thereby forcing the acquisition.

## Summary

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) refers to various ways in which companies and their assets are purchased, integrated, or combined with another company. An acquisition typically involves the complete purchase of one company by another company; while in a merger, the two companies usually combine to form a new company.

The financing methods for mergers and acquisitions can be a combination of stocks, debt, or cash. They can be friendly or unfriendly; unfriendly acquisitions are typically known as hostile takeovers, which are not desired by the company being acquired.
