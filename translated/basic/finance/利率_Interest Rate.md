## What is Interest Rate?

Interest rate is the fee charged by lenders to borrowers, typically expressed as a percentage of the principal (loan amount). Loan interest rates are usually calculated annually and expressed as Annual Percentage Rate (APR).

Interest rates also apply to savings accounts or Certificates of Deposit (CDs). In these cases, banks or credit unions pay account holders a percentage of their deposited funds. Annual Percentage Yield (APY) refers to the interest earned on these deposit accounts.

### Key Points

- Interest rate is the fee charged by lenders to borrowers beyond the principal amount for the use of assets.
- Interest rates also apply to the amount earned by banks or credit unions on deposit accounts.
- Most mortgages use simple interest, but some loans use compound interest, which applies to both the principal and previously accumulated interest.
- Borrowers considered low-risk by lenders will enjoy lower interest rates; loans considered high-risk will be charged higher interest rates.
- APY is the interest rate earned by banks or credit unions on savings accounts or CDs, with deposit accounts and CDs using compound interest calculations.

## Understanding Interest Rates

Interest is essentially the cost for borrowers to use assets. Borrowed assets can include cash, consumer goods, vehicles, and real estate. Therefore, interest rates can be viewed as the "cost of funds" - the higher the interest rate, the higher the cost of borrowing the same amount.

Interest rates apply to most lending or borrowing transactions. Individuals borrow to purchase homes, fund projects, start or expand businesses, or pay for college education. Businesses use loans to finance capital projects and expand operations, such as purchasing land, buildings, and machinery as fixed assets. Borrowed money is typically repaid on agreed-upon dates either as a lump sum or in installments.

For loans, interest rates are applied to the principal, which is the amount borrowed. The interest rate represents both the cost of debt for the borrower and the rate of return for the lender. The repayment amount is typically higher than the borrowed amount because lenders need to be compensated for the loss of use of funds during the loan period. During this time, the lender could have invested this money to generate profits. The difference between the total repayment amount and the original loan is the interest charged.

When borrowers are considered low-risk by lenders, they typically receive lower interest rates; if borrowers are viewed as high-risk, higher interest rates are charged, resulting in higher loan costs.

**Important Note:** Risk is typically assessed when lenders review potential borrowers' credit scores, so having a good credit score is crucial if you want to secure the most favorable loan terms.

## Simple Interest

Suppose you borrow $300,000 from a bank, and the loan contract stipulates a 4% simple interest rate. This means you need to repay the original loan amount of $300,000 plus (4% x $300,000) = $300,000 + $12,000 = $312,000 to the bank.

The above example is calculated based on the annual simple interest formula:

If the borrower only needs a one-year loan, they will need to pay $12,000 in interest at the end of the year. If the loan is a 30-year mortgage, the interest payment would be:

Simple Interest = $300,000 x 4% x 30 = $360,000

The annual interest rate of 4% translates to an annual interest expense of $12,000. After 30 years, the borrower will pay $12,000 x 30 years = $360,000 in interest, which explains how banks profit through loans, mortgages, and other types of lending.

## Compound Interest Rate

Some lenders prefer to use compound interest calculation methods, which means borrowers pay more interest. Compound interest, also known as interest on interest, applies to both the principal and accumulated interest from previous periods. Banks assume that at the end of the first year, the borrower owes the principal plus that year's interest; at the end of the second year, the borrower owes the principal, plus the first year's interest, plus compound interest on the first year.

When calculating compound interest, the interest owed is higher than with simple interest methods. Interest is charged monthly on the principal, which includes accumulated interest from previous months. For shorter time periods, the interest calculations are similar between the two methods. However, as the loan duration increases, the difference between these two calculation methods grows larger.

Using the above example, at the end of 30 years, the total interest on a $300,000 loan at 4% interest rate approaches $673,019.

The following formula can be used to calculate compound interest:

Looking at another example. A loan of $10,000 with 5% interest rate for three years results in an interest amount of $1,576.25:

## Compound Interest and Savings Accounts

Compound interest works in your favor when using savings accounts. The interest earned on the account is compounded, serving as compensation to the account holder for allowing the bank to use the deposited funds.

For example, if you deposit $500,000 into a high-yield savings account, the bank can use $300,000 of that for mortgage loans. For this, the bank pays you 5% interest annually. Thus, the bank charges borrowers 8% interest while paying 5% to account holders, resulting in a net interest rate of 3%. In effect, depositors lend money to the bank, which then provides it to borrowers in exchange for interest.

## Borrower's Cost of Debt

While interest rates represent interest income for lenders, they constitute the cost of debt for borrowers. When companies evaluate borrowing costs, they compare them with the cost of equity (such as dividend payments) to determine which financing method is least expensive. Since most companies choose between debt and equity issuance when funding capital, the assessment of capital costs aims to achieve an optimal capital structure.

## APR and APY

Loan interest rates for consumers are typically expressed as Annual Percentage Rate (APR), which is the rate of return required by lenders for borrowing. For example, credit card interest rates are expressed as APR. In the above example, 4% is the APR of the mortgage. APR does not take into account compound interest within the year.

Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is the interest rate earned on savings accounts or CDs from banks or credit unions, which takes into account the effect of compound interest.

## How are Interest Rates Determined?

Interest rates charged by banks are influenced by various factors, such as economic conditions. A country's central bank (such as the Federal Reserve System in the United States) sets interest rates, and banks determine their APR ranges based on this rate. When the central bank sets higher interest rates, the cost of debt increases, which in turn suppresses borrowing and consumer demand. Interest rates tend to rise with inflation.

To curb inflation, banks may increase reserve requirements, leading to tighter money supply, or increase demand for credit. In a high interest rate economic environment, people tend to save because they can earn more from their savings. The stock market suffers because investors prefer to take advantage of high-yield savings rather than invest in lower-yielding stocks. Businesses are also constrained when seeking capital funding, leading to economic contraction.

During periods of low interest rates, the economy tends to be stimulated as borrowers can obtain loans at low costs. Due to low savings rates, businesses and individuals are more likely to spend and purchase riskier investment instruments, such as stocks. This spending stimulates the economy and injects vitality into capital markets, promoting economic expansion.

Although governments tend to prefer lower interest rates, this ultimately leads to market imbalances where demand exceeds supply, triggering inflation. When inflation occurs, interest rates rise, which may be related to Walras's Law.

## Interest Rates and Discrimination

Despite laws prohibiting discriminatory lending practices such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), systemic racism persists in the United States.

Research evidence shows that white individuals have higher chances of mortgage loan approval. According to data reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, in 2022, Black, Hispanic white, and Asian applicants were denied conventional mortgage loans at rates of 16.4%, 11.1%, and 9.2% respectively. In contrast, white applicants faced a significantly lower rejection rate of just 5.8%. Data also indicates that race affects interest rates. Based on mortgage data from 2018 and 2019, Realtor.com found that homebuyers in predominantly Black neighborhoods received mortgage interest rates that were 13 basis points higher than those offered to homebuyers in white neighborhoods.

Other sources, including Harvard University and the Urban Institute, have confirmed the existence of mortgage interest rate discrimination. In 2022, these institutions claimed that the average Black homeowner pays interest rates 33 basis points higher than the average white homeowner, resulting in approximately $250 more in interest payments annually.

Not everyone agrees with these findings. A study by Federal Reserve economists suggested that no racial group received preferential treatment, leading the authors to speculate that disparities reported elsewhere might be due to Black and Hispanic borrowers tending to choose slightly higher interest rates in exchange for lower upfront costs.

The Federal Reserve believes discrimination has improved, partly crediting automated underwriting and stricter enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

## Why are 30-year loan rates higher than 15-year loan rates?

Interest rates depend on default risk and opportunity cost. Long-term loans and debt are inherently riskier because borrowers have a longer period during which they could potentially default. Additionally, the opportunity cost over a longer period is greater because the principal is locked up during this time and cannot be used for other purposes.

## How Does the Federal Reserve Use Interest Rates in the Economy?

Like other central banks around the world, the Federal Reserve uses interest rates as a monetary policy tool. By raising the borrowing costs for commercial banks, the central bank can influence many other interest rates, such as personal loans, commercial loans, and mortgages. This generally makes borrowing more expensive, thereby reducing the demand for funds and cooling an overheated economy. Conversely, lowering interest rates makes it easier to borrow funds, thus stimulating consumption and investment.

## Why Do Bond Prices React Inversely to Interest Rate Changes?

A bond is a debt instrument that typically pays fixed-rate interest throughout its lifecycle. If the prevailing interest rate is 5%, a bond priced at $1,000 with a 5% interest rate (coupon) will pay $50 in annual interest to the bondholder. If interest rates rise to 10%, newly issued bonds will pay double the interest, meaning $100 per $1,000 face value. Existing bonds that only pay $50 would need to be sold at a significant discount for anyone to be willing to buy them. Similarly, if interest rates fall to 1%, new bonds will only pay $10 interest per $1,000 face value. Therefore, bonds paying $50 will be highly sought after, and their prices will be driven up.

## Summary

Interest rates represent the cost of debt for borrowers and the rate of return for lenders. When you borrow money, you need to pay additional fees to the lending entity as compensation. Similarly, when you deposit funds into a savings account, financial institutions may reward you because they can use these funds to provide more loans to their customers.

These fees or payments are called interest and are calculated at predetermined interest rates.
