## What is a Leveraged Buyout?

A leveraged buyout (LBO) refers to when a company acquires another company using substantial borrowed funds to finance the acquisition cost. These borrowings can take the form of bonds or loans. The assets of the acquired company are typically used as collateral for the loans, along with the assets of the acquiring company serving as security.

### Key Points

- A leveraged buyout (LBO) occurs when a company acquisition is completed almost entirely using borrowed funds.
- After the 2008 financial crisis, the popularity of leveraged buyouts declined, but has recently begun to rebound.
- In leveraged buyouts, the ratio of debt to equity used for the acquisition is typically kept as high as possible.
- Leveraged buyouts are considered an aggressive and predatory business strategy because the target company's assets can be used as leverage against itself.

## Understanding Leveraged Buyouts (LBO)

In a leveraged buyout, the ratio of debt to equity used for the acquisition is typically kept as high as possible. The specific amount of debt used depends on market lending conditions, investor requirements, and the company's expected post-acquisition cash flows.[1] The bonds issued during the acquisition are usually not considered investment grade and are therefore called junk bonds, precisely due to this high debt-to-equity ratio.

**Important Note:** The purpose of a leveraged buyout is to enable companies to make large-scale acquisitions without requiring substantial amounts of their own capital.

Returns from leveraged buyouts are typically achieved through three methods:

- The company repays debt, and this deleveraging process increases the company's equity.
- Investors improve profit margins by reducing or eliminating unnecessary expenses and enhancing sales.
- The company will be sold at a higher multiple than what the investment firm paid at the end of the investment period, a process known as multiple expansion.

Private equity groups conducting leveraged buyouts are notorious for needing to rapidly increase profit margins and are often viewed as ruthless and predatory. To achieve this goal, many investors implement strict cost-cutting measures, which may include layoffs.

To realize returns, private equity investors must sell or monetize their investments within a relatively short timeframe. Typically, LBO investments are held for 5 to 7 years, though they can be shorter or longer than this range.

There are several ways to monetize the investment:

- Taking the private company public
- Selling to competitors
- Conducting a second round of private investment through another LBO

Typically, LBOs are conducted because private equity groups have identified a company as a suitable target. A suitable target usually needs to generate annual returns exceeding 20%, so the company must be able to generate cash to repay debt ("deleveraging") and should have opportunities for improving profits and market value.

## Examples of Leveraged Buyouts

One of the largest recorded LBOs was the 2006 acquisition of Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR), Bain Capital, and Merrill Lynch, with the three firms valuing HCA at approximately $33 billion.[2]

After the 2008 financial crisis, the number of such large-scale acquisitions declined, but as the COVID-19 pandemic subsided, large LBOs increased again. In 2021, a group of financiers led by Blackstone Group announced the leveraged buyout of medical equipment manufacturer Medline, valued at $34 billion.[3][4]

Vista Equity Partners and Elliott Investment Management conducted the first major leveraged buyout of 2022 in January, acquiring software manufacturer Citrix Systems, Inc. for $13 billion.[5]

According to Yahoo Finance in December 2023, leveraged loans are expected to experience a new boom in 2024.[6]

## How Does a Leveraged Buyout Work?

A leveraged buyout (LBO) occurs when a company attempts to acquire another company by borrowing a large amount of money. The acquiring company typically issues bonds backed by the combined assets of both companies, allowing the target company's assets to serve as collateral.

Although large-scale LBOs experienced a revival in the early 2020s, they are often viewed as predatory or hostile actions. [7]

## Why Do Leveraged Buyouts Occur?

Leveraged buyouts (LBOs) are typically used to take public companies private or to divest business units through partial sales. They can also be used for private asset transfers, such as changes in small business ownership. The main advantage of leveraged buyouts is that the acquiring company can purchase larger-scale companies with a relatively small base of their own assets.

## What Types of Companies are Suitable for LBO?

Private equity firms typically prefer to conduct leveraged buyouts of companies in mature, stable industries rather than startups or more risky sectors.[8] The ideal candidates for LBOs usually have stable, reliable operating cash flows, mature product lines, strong management teams, and viable exit strategies that allow acquirers to realize returns.

## Conclusion

A leveraged buyout (LBO) refers to the acquisition of a company primarily using borrowed funds. Companies typically conduct LBOs to take a company private or divest portions of existing business operations.

Since target companies have little control over transaction approval, and their own assets may be used as leverage against them, leveraged buyouts are often viewed as a predatory business strategy. LBO activity declined after the 2008 financial crisis but has increased since then.
