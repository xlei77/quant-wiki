## What is a Multi-Factor Model?

A multi-factor model is a financial model that uses multiple factors in its calculations to explain market phenomena and/or equilibrium asset prices. Multi-factor models can be used to explain individual securities or portfolios of securities by comparing two or more factors, analyzing the relationships between variables and their impact on performance outcomes.

### Key Points

- Multi-factor models are financial modeling strategies that use multiple factors to analyze and explain asset prices.
- Multi-factor models reveal which factors have the greatest impact on asset prices.
- Multi-factor portfolios can be constructed through various methods including cross-sectional, portfolio-based, and sequential approaches.
- A security's beta measures its systematic risk compared to the overall market.
- The Fama-French three-factor model is a prominent tool that builds upon the Capital Asset Pricing Model by incorporating size and value factors in addition to market risk.

## Understanding Multi-Factor Models

Multi-factor models are used to construct investment portfolios with specific characteristics (such as risk) or to track indices. When building multi-factor models, determining how many and which factors to include is challenging. Additionally, models are typically based on historical data, which may not accurately predict future values.

Multi-factor models also help explain the weights of different factors in the model, thus indicating which factors have more significant impacts on asset prices.

## Multi-Factor Model Formula

Factor comparison uses the following formula:

Ri = ai + _i(m) *Rm +_i(1)* F1 + _i(2) *F2 +...+_i(N)* FN + ei

Where:

Ri is the security's return rate

Rm is the market return rate

F(1, 2, 3 ... N) represents each factor used

_ is the beta value associated with each factor (including market (m))

e is the error term

a is the intercept

## Types of Multi-Factor Models

Multi-factor models can be classified into three categories: macroeconomic models, fundamental models, and statistical models.

Macroeconomic Models: Macroeconomic models compare securities returns with factors such as employment, inflation, and interest rates.

Fundamental Models: Fundamental models analyze the relationship between securities returns and their basic financial indicators (such as earnings, market capitalization, and debt levels).

Statistical Models: Statistical models are used to compare returns across different securities based on each security's own statistical performance, typically using historical data for modeling.

## Construction of Multi-Factor Models

When constructing multi-factor models, the three most commonly used models are composite models, sequential models, and cross-sectional models.

Composite Models: In composite models, multiple single-factor models (which use individual factors to differentiate stocks) are combined to create a multi-factor model. For example, stocks can be ranked solely based on momentum in the first screening, while subsequent screenings will use other factors such as volatility for classification.

Sequential Models: Sequential models construct multi-factor models by ranking stocks sequentially based on individual factors. For example, stocks of a specific market capitalization can be analyzed sequentially using various factors such as value and momentum.

Cross-sectional Models: In cross-sectional models, stocks are ranked based on the intersection of factors. For example, stocks can be classified based on the intersection of value and momentum.

## Beta Measurement

A security's beta measures its systematic risk compared to the overall market. A beta of 1 indicates that the security theoretically experiences the same degree of volatility as the market and moves in sync with it.

A beta greater than 1 implies that the security theoretically has greater volatility than the market. While a beta less than 1 implies that the security theoretically has less volatility than the market.

When investment managers use multi-factor models to evaluate investment risk, beta is an important factor they can utilize.

## Fama-French Three-Factor Model

A widely used multi-factor model is the Fama-French Three-Factor Model. The model includes three factors: company size, book-to-market ratio, and market excess returns. In other words, the three factors used are SMB (Small Minus Big), HML (High Minus Low), and portfolio returns minus the risk-free rate.

SMB considers listed companies with small market capitalization that generate high returns, while HML considers value stocks with high book-to-market ratios, which tend to generate higher returns compared to the market.
