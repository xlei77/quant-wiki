## What is an Annuity Table?

An annuity table is a tool used to determine the present value of an annuity or other structured series of payments. This tool is commonly used by accountants, actuaries, and other insurance professionals, and it takes into account both the amount invested in the annuity and its duration to determine the amount that should be paid to the annuity purchaser or beneficiary.

The present value of any future annuity amount can also be calculated using financial calculators or specially designed software.

### Key Points

- An annuity table is a tool used to determine the present value of an annuity.
- Annuity tables calculate the present value of an annuity by applying discount rates to future payments.
- Annuity tables provide the appropriate factor using discount rates and number of payment periods.
- Using an annuity table, you multiply the periodic payment amount by the given factor.

## How Annuity Tables Work

Annuity tables provide a factor based on time and discount rate (interest rate), which when multiplied by annuity payments determines their present value. For example, if the expected interest rate is 3%, an annuity table can be used to calculate the present value of an annuity that pays $10,000 annually for 15 years.

**Important Note:** According to the time value of money concept, a lump sum amount paid today is worth more than receiving the same amount in the future.

Having $10,000 today is worth more than receiving $1,000 annually for 10 years because this money can be invested to earn interest. At the end of the 10-year period, the present value of $10,000 will exceed the sum of all annual payments, even when invested at the same interest rate.

## Annuity Tables and Present Value of Annuities

The present value formula for an ordinary annuity (different from an annuity due) is as follows:

$$ \begin{aligned}&\text{P} =\text{PMT}\times\frac{ 1 - (1 + r) ^ -n}{r}\\&\textbf{其中：}\\&\text{P} = \text{年金流的现值}\\&\text{PMT} =\text{每笔年金支付的金额}\\&r = \text{利率（即折现率）}\\&n = \text{支付期数}\end{aligned} $$

Suppose someone has the opportunity to receive an annuity paying $50,000 annually for 25 years with a discount rate of 6%, or a one-time payment of $650,000. They need to determine the more reasonable choice. Using the above formula, the present value of the annuity is:

$$ \begin{aligned}&\text{PVA} = \$50,000 \times \frac{1 - (1 + 0.06) ^ -25}{0.06} = \$639,168\\&\textbf{其中：}\\&\text{PVA}=\text{年金的现值}\end{aligned} $$

Based on this information, from a time-adjusted perspective, this annuity is worth $10,832 less, so the person should choose the lump-sum payment.

Note that this formula applies to ordinary annuities, where payments are made at the end of each period. In the above example, each $50,000 payment would be made at the end of each year for 25 years. For annuities due, payments are made at the beginning of the period. To calculate the present value of an annuity due, multiply the above formula by a factor of (1 + r):

$$ \begin{aligned}&\text{P} = \text{PMT} \times\left(\frac{1 - (1 + r) ^ -n}{r}\right) \times (1 + r)\end{aligned} $$

If the above example were an annuity due, its value would be:

$$ \begin{aligned}&\text{P}= \$50,000\\&\quad \times\left( \frac{1 - (1 + 0.06) ^ -25}{0.06}\right)\times (1 + 0.06) = \$677,518\end{aligned} $$

In this case, the person should choose the annuity due, as its value exceeds the lump-sum payment by $27,518.

As an alternative to calculating using the above formulas, you can use annuity tables. Annuity tables simplify calculations by automatically providing a factor for the latter half of the formula. For example, an ordinary annuity table will give you a number (called a factor) that is preset for the (1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r) portion of the formula.

The factor is determined by the interest rate (r in the formula) and the number of payment periods (n in the formula). In annuity tables, periods are typically listed in the left column, and interest rates are listed in the top row. Simply select the correct interest rate and number of periods to find the factor at their intersection. This factor is then multiplied by the dollar amount of the annuity payment to obtain the present value of an ordinary annuity.

Here is an example of a present value table for ordinary annuities:

|n|1%|2%|3%|4%|5%|6%
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|0.9901|0.9804|0.9709|0.9615|0.9524|0.9434
|2|1.9704|1.9416|1.9135|1.8861|1.8594|1.8334
|3|2.9410|2.8839|2.8286|2.7751|2.7233|2.6730
|4|3.9020|3.8077|3.7171|3.6299|3.5460|3.4651
|5|4.8534|4.7135|4.5797|4.4518|4.3295|4.2124
|10|9.4713|8.9826|8.5302|8.1109|7.7217|7.3601
|15|13.8651|12.8493|11.9380|11.1184|10.3797|9.7123
|20|18.0456|16.3514|14.8775|13.5903|12.4622|11.4699
|25|22.0232|19.5235|17.4132|15.6221|14.0939|12.7834

Using our earlier example with 6% interest rate and 25 years, you'll find the factor = 12.7834. Multiplying this factor from the annuity table by the $50,000 payment amount gives you $639,170, almost identical to the $639,168 calculated earlier using the formula. The small difference between the numbers reflects rounding in the table's factor of 12.7834.

There is a separate table for annuities due, which provides the correct factors according to the second formula.

## What is an Annuity?

An annuity is an insurance contract that provides a stream of income, typically during retirement. Annuities can be fixed, variable, or indexed. It has two phases: first, the accumulation (savings) phase, followed by the payout (income) phase. Payments can be immediate or deferred.

## What is the difference between ordinary annuity and annuity due?

An ordinary annuity generates payments at the end of each period, while an annuity due is an annuity that is expected or paid at the beginning of each payment period.

## Can Lottery Winners Use Annuity Tables?

Lottery winners can use annuity tables to determine which option is more economically beneficial: receiving the lottery prize as a lump sum today or choosing payments spread over multiple years. However, lottery prizes represent a relatively rare form of annuity. More commonly, annuities are a type of investment used to provide individuals with stable retirement income.

## Summary

Annuity tables are primarily used by accounting, insurance, and other financial professionals to determine the present value of annuities. They take into account both the amount invested in the annuity and its duration, thus facilitating the determination of the amount that should be paid to the annuity purchaser or annuitant.
