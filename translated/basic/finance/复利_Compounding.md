## What is Compound Interest?

Compound interest refers to reinvesting the returns on assets (including capital appreciation or interest) to generate additional returns over time. This growth is calculated through an exponential function, as investments earn returns not only from the initial principal but also from previously accumulated returns.

Therefore, compound interest differs from linear growth, where interest is only earned on the principal each period.

### Key Points

- Compound interest is the process of adding interest to the existing principal and previously paid interest.
- Therefore, compound interest can be understood as "interest on interest" - its effect is to amplify interest earnings over time, which is known as the "miracle of compound interest."
- When banks or financial institutions calculate compound interest, they typically use compounding periods such as annual, monthly, or daily.
- Compound interest can occur on investments where returns grow rapidly, or on debts where the amount owed can increase even if payments are being made.
- Compound interest naturally occurs in savings accounts; some dividend-paying investments may also benefit from compound interest.

## Understanding Compound Interest

Compound interest typically refers to the increase in asset value due to interest generated from both principal and accumulated interest. This phenomenon is a direct manifestation of the "time value" concept and is also known as compounding.

Compound interest is crucial in finance, as the returns it generates are the driving force behind many investment strategies. For example, many companies offer Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs), allowing investors to reinvest their cash dividends to purchase additional shares. Reinvesting in these dividend-paying stocks accelerates investor returns because the increased number of shares consistently enhances future dividend income, assuming dividends remain stable.

Building upon dividend reinvestment, investing in dividend growth stocks adds another layer of compounding to this strategy, which some investors refer to as "double compounding." In this case, not only are dividends reinvested to purchase more shares, but the per-share dividend of these dividend growth stocks is also increasing.

## Compound Interest Formula

The future value (FV) formula for current assets relies on the concept of compound interest. It considers the present value of assets, annual interest rate, frequency of compounding per year (or number of compounding periods), and total number of years. The general formula for compound interest is:

$$ \begin{aligned}&FV = PV \times \Big (1 + \frac{ i }{ n } \Big ) ^ {nt} \\&\textbf{其中:} \\&FV = \text{未来价值} \\&PV = \text{现值} \\&i = \text{年利率} \\&n = \text{每周期的复利期数} \\&t = \text{时间周期} \\\end{aligned} $$

This formula assumes there are no changes to the original principal balance other than interest.

**536,870,912:** Want to know what 100% daily compound interest looks like? The folk tale "A Grain of Rice" by Demi revolves around a reward that starts with one grain of rice on the first day, then doubles the number of grains each subsequent day for 30 days. By the last day of the month, the cumulative reward exceeds 536 million grains of rice.[2]

## Increasing Compound Interest Periods

The effect of compound interest strengthens as the frequency of compounding increases. Assuming one year as a time period, more compounding periods lead to a higher future value of investment; clearly, two compounding periods per year are better than one, and four periods are better than two.

To illustrate this effect, consider the following example. Assume an investment of $1 million with an annual return rate of 20%. The future values based on different numbers of compounding periods are as follows:

- Annual compounding (n = 1): FV = $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/1)] (1 x 1) = $1,200,000
- Semi-annual compounding (n = 2): FV = $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/2)] (2 x 1) = $1,210,000
- Quarterly compounding (n = 4): FV = $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/4)] (4 x 1) = $1,215,506
- Monthly compounding (n = 12): FV = $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/12)] (12 x 1) = $1,219,391
- Weekly compounding (n = 52): FV = $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/52)] (52 x 1) = $1,220,934
- Daily compounding (n = 365): FV = $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/365)] (365 x 1) = $1,221,336

Evidently, despite the significant increase in the number of compounding periods, the growth in future value tends to stabilize. The frequency of compounding within a given time period has a limited impact on investment growth. This limit is known as "continuous compounding" and can be calculated using the following formula:

$$ \begin{aligned}&FV=P\times e^{rt}\\&\textbf{其中:}\\&e=\text{无理数 2.7183}\\&r=\text{利率}\\&t=\text{时间}\end{aligned} $$

In the above example, the future value with continuous compounding is: FV = $1,000,000 × 2.7183 (0.2 x 1) = $1,221,404.

**Note:** Compound interest is an example of a "snowball effect," where small impacts gradually accumulate to form a larger, more significant state.

## The Impact of Compound Interest on Investments and Debt

Compound interest works on both assets and liabilities. While compound interest rapidly increases the value of assets, it can also increase loan amounts because unpaid principal and previous interest accumulate to generate more interest. Even with loan repayments, compound interest can lead to an increase in total future debt.

The concept of compound interest is particularly tricky with credit card balances. Credit card debt not only carries high interest rates, but interest charges can also be added to the principal balance, which then generates interest in the future. For this reason, the impact of compound interest isn't necessarily "good" or "bad." The effects of compound interest can vary depending on the investor's specific financial situation.

## Compound Interest Example

To illustrate how compound interest works, assume there is $10,000 in an account with an annual interest rate of 5%. At the end of the first compounding period, the total amount in the account rises to $10,500, reflecting the $500 interest added to the $10,000 principal. In the second year, the account grows by 5% on both the original principal and the first year's $500 interest, resulting in a second-year gain of $525, bringing the total balance to $11,025.

| Compound Interest Example |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compounding Period | Starting Balance | Interest | Ending Balance |
| 1 | $10,000.00 | $500.00 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/1)] (1 x 1) = $010,500.00 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/1)] (1 x 1) = $111,025.00 |
| 3 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/1)] (1 x 1) = $2551.25 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/1)] (1 x 1) = $311,576.25 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/1)] (1 x 1) = $412,155.06 |
| 5 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/1)] (1 x 1) = $5607.75 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/1)] (1 x 1) = $612,762.82 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/1)] (1 x 1) = $713,400.96 |
| 7 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/1)] (1 x 1) = $8670.05 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/1)] (1 x 1) = $914,071.00 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/2)] (2 x 1) = $014,774.55 |
| 9 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/2)] (2 x 1) = $1738.73 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/2)] (2 x 1) = $215,513.28 | $1,000,000 × [1 + (20%/2)] (2 x 1) = $316,288.95 |

After 10 years, if there are no withdrawals and the annual interest rate remains stable at 5%, the account will grow to $16,288.95. Without any additions or withdrawals to the principal, the effect of compound interest increases the balance change from $500 in the first period to $775.66 in the tenth period.

Furthermore, over 10 years, our investment grew by $6,288.95. If this investment only paid simple interest (5% of the original investment), the interest would only be $500 per year (totaling $5,000 over 10 years).

## What is the Rule of 72?

The Rule of 72 is a heuristic method used to estimate the time required for an investment or savings to double under compound interest (or continuous returns). The rule states that the number of years needed is 72 divided by the interest rate. For example, with a 5% interest rate and compound interest, it would take approximately 14 years and 5 months to double.[4]

## What is the difference between simple interest and compound interest?

Simple interest only pays interest on the principal amount invested or deposited. For example, if you deposit $1,000 with an annual interest rate of 5%, you will earn $50 in interest each year. However, compound interest pays "interest on interest," so in the first year you will receive $50, and in the second year you will receive $52.5 ($1,050 × 0.05), and so on.

## How to Compound My Capital?

In addition to compound interest, investors can achieve compound returns through dividend reinvestment. This means using received dividend payments to purchase additional shares of the company, which will in turn pay dividends in the future.

## Which Type of Average is Most Suitable for Compound Interest?

There are multiple ways to calculate averages in finance. When calculating the average returns of investments or savings accounts with compound interest, it's best to use the geometric mean. In finance, this is sometimes referred to as the time-weighted average return or Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR).

## What is the best example of compound interest?

A high-yield savings account is an excellent example of compound interest. Suppose you deposit $1,000 in a savings account. In the first year, you will earn a certain amount of interest. If you don't spend any funds in the account and the interest rate stays at least at the previous year's level, then the interest income in the second year will be higher. This is because the savings account adds the earned interest to the cash balance, which then generates more interest.

## Summary

Compound interest and compounding play a crucial role in investors' financial success. If you utilize compound interest, you will earn more money more quickly; if you bear compound interest debt, you will be trapped in increasingly larger debt for a long time. Through compounding, financial balances can grow exponentially faster than linear interest.
