Passive investing is an investment strategy that maximizes returns by minimizing buy and sell transactions. Index investing is a common strategy in passive investing, where investors buy and hold representative benchmarks (such as the S&P 500 index) for the long term. Passive investing stands in contrast to active investing.

### Key Points

- Passive investing typically refers to a buy-and-hold portfolio strategy, suitable for long-term investment cycles with very low market trading frequency.
- Index investing is perhaps the most common form of passive investing, where investors aim to replicate and hold broad market indices.
- Compared to actively managed portfolios, passive investing generally has lower costs, less complexity, and often generates superior after-tax returns over medium to long-term periods.

## Understanding Passive Investment

Passive investment approaches aim to avoid costs and limited performance that may arise from frequent trading. The goal of passive investment is to gradually accumulate wealth. Known as a buy-and-hold strategy, passive investing means purchasing securities and holding them for the long term. Unlike active traders, passive investors do not seek to profit from short-term price fluctuations or market timing. The fundamental assumption of passive investment strategies is that markets will generate positive returns over the long term.

Passive managers generally believe that trying to outperform the market is difficult, so they strive to match market or sector performance. Passive investing attempts to replicate market performance by constructing well-diversified portfolios of individual stocks, which would require extensive research if studied individually. The introduction of index funds in the 1970s made it easier to achieve returns consistent with the market. By the 1990s, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) tracking major indices, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), further simplified this process, allowing investors to trade index funds just like stocks.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Passive Investment

Maintaining a well-diversified investment portfolio is crucial for successful investing, and achieving diversification through index investing is feasible. Index funds broadly diversify risk by holding representative securities from their target benchmarks. Index funds track target benchmarks or indices rather than seeking winners. Therefore, they avoid constant buying and selling of securities. As a result, their fees and operating costs are typically lower than actively managed funds.

Index funds, as a simple investment approach, are easy to understand as they seek to track indices. There's no need to select and monitor individual fund managers or make choices among investment themes.

However, passive investing also faces overall market risk. Index funds track the entire market, so when the overall stock market or bond prices fall, index funds will fall accordingly. Another risk is lack of flexibility. Index fund managers usually cannot employ defensive measures such as reducing stock positions, even if they believe stock prices will fall. Passively managed index funds face performance constraints because they are designed to provide returns closely linked to their benchmark indices rather than pursuing excess returns. They rarely exceed index returns and typically perform slightly below due to operating costs.

Some key advantages of passive investing include:

- Extremely low fees: No stock picking means greatly reduced management costs. Passive funds follow their benchmark indices.
- Transparency: The assets in an index fund are always clearly visible.
- Tax efficiency: Their buy-and-hold strategy typically doesn't result in large annual capital gains taxes.
- Simplicity: Holding an index or set of indices is far easier to implement and understand than dynamic strategies requiring constant research and adjustment.

Advocates of active investing might say passive strategies have these weaknesses:

- Too restrictive: Passive funds are limited to specific indices or preset investment sets with little variation. Thus, investors are locked into these holdings regardless of market conditions.
- Limited potential returns: By definition, passive funds almost never beat the market, even during volatile periods, as their core holdings are locked to track the market. Sometimes passive funds might slightly exceed the market, but unless the market itself prospers, they'll never deliver the high returns active managers aspire to. Active managers can deliver higher returns (see below), though these come with greater risks.

**Note:** Fund fees vary. Actively managed funds typically have higher operating costs than passively managed funds, but it's always crucial to check fees before choosing investment funds.

To compare passive investing's pros and cons, active investing similarly has its advantages and disadvantages:

- Flexibility: Active investors don't have to follow specific indices. They can buy stocks they consider "cherry-picked."
- Hedging: Active managers can use various techniques (like short selling or put options) to hedge risks and can exit specific stocks or sectors when risks become too high. Passive investors are forced to hold stocks included in the index regardless of performance.
- Tax management: Although this strategy may trigger capital gains taxes, advisors can tailor tax management strategies to individual investors' needs, such as offsetting big winners' taxes by selling losing investments.

But active strategies also have these drawbacks:

- Very high fees: Due to all that active buying and selling triggering transaction costs, plus paying salaries for teams of analysts researching stock picks. Over decades of investing, all these fees can erode returns. In 2020, actively managed mutual funds averaged 0.71% in fees, while passive funds averaged 0.06%.
- Active risk: Active managers are free to buy any investments they think will bring high returns, which is good when analysts are right but terrible when they're wrong.
- Poor track record: Data shows few actively managed portfolios outperform their passive benchmarks, especially after taxes and fees. In fact, only a small number of actively managed mutual funds beat their benchmark indices over medium to long-term timeframes.

## How to Start Passive Investing?

Purchasing index funds is a common passive investment strategy. Index funds aim to mirror the activity of market indices, such as the Russell 2000 Index. Index funds seek to maximize long-term returns by reducing trading frequency.

Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are another common choice for passive investors. ETFs can be either passively or actively managed. Index-based ETFs, like index funds, track the activity of securities indices.

## What are the fees associated with passive investing?

Passive investing is typically cheaper than active investing because fund managers don't pick stocks or bonds. Passive funds allow a particular index to guide the traded securities, which means there are no additional research analyst costs.

Even passively managed funds charge fees. When deciding which fund to invest in, it's crucial to investigate the associated fees.

## What are the Return Expectations for Passive vs Active Investing?

Active investing aims to drive returns through frequent trading, but these returns are reduced by fees associated with professional management and frequent buying and selling. Research shows that few actively managed funds are able to deliver returns above their benchmark over long periods of time.

Passive investing aims to achieve strong returns over the long term by minimizing the frequency of buying and selling, but is unlikely to beat the market and generate excess returns in the short term. Active investing can deliver higher returns but comes with greater risks compared to passive investing.

## Conclusion

Passive investing has both advantages and disadvantages compared to active investing. This strategy may result in lower fees and higher tax efficiency, but potential short-term returns may be limited and typically lower than active investing. For investors seeking lower-risk returns over a longer time horizon, passive investing represents an attractive option.
