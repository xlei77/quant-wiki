## What is Equity?

Equity, commonly known as shareholders' equity (or owner's equity for private enterprises), represents the amount that would be returned to shareholders if all company assets were liquidated and all debts were paid off. In the case of acquisitions, equity is the value of the company's sales minus any liabilities that do not transfer with the sale.

Furthermore, shareholders' equity can also represent the book value of a company. Equity can sometimes be offered as a form of in-kind payment. It also represents proportional ownership of a company's shares. Equity appears on a company's balance sheet and is one of the common metrics analysts use to evaluate a company's financial health.

### Key Points

- Equity represents the value that would be returned to shareholders if all company assets were liquidated and all debts were paid off.
- We can also view equity as the degree of residual ownership in a company or asset after deducting all associated liabilities.
- Equity represents shareholders' stake in the company and is identified on the company's balance sheet.
- The formula for calculating equity is total assets minus total liabilities, and it is used in several key financial ratios such as Return on Equity (ROE).
- Home equity is the value of a homeowner's property (amount after deducting debt), which is another usage of the term equity.

## How Shareholders' Equity Works

The shareholders' equity formula of "assets minus liabilities" clearly depicts a company's financial position by comparing specific numbers that reflect everything a company owns against everything it owes, making it easy for investors and analysts to interpret. Equity serves as capital raised by companies, which is then used to purchase assets, invest in projects, and fund operations. Companies typically can raise funds either by issuing debt (in the form of loans or bonds) or equity (by selling stocks). Investors often seek equity investments because they offer greater opportunities to share in company profits and growth.

The importance of equity lies in its representation of investors' stake in the company, divided proportionally by shares. Owning company stock enables shareholders to receive capital gains and dividends, while equity ownership also grants shareholders voting rights on corporate actions and board elections. These benefits of equity ownership promote shareholders' continued interest in the company.

Shareholders' equity can be either negative or positive. A positive value indicates the company has sufficient assets to cover its liabilities; a negative value suggests the company's liabilities exceed its assets; if this situation persists, it is considered balance sheet insolvency. Generally, investors view companies with negative shareholders' equity as risky or unsafe investments. Shareholders' equity alone cannot accurately reveal a company's financial health; combined with other tools and indicators, investors can analyze an organization's health more comprehensively.

## Shareholder Equity Calculation Formula

The following formula and calculation method can be used to determine a company's shareholder equity, which is derived from the accounting balance equation:

$$ \text{股东权益} = \text{总资产} - \text{总负债} $$

This information can be found on the balance sheet and should follow these four steps:

Shareholder equity can also be expressed as the company's share capital plus retained earnings minus the value of treasury stock. However, this method is less common. Although both methods yield the same number, using total assets and total liabilities provides a more intuitive reflection of the company's financial health.

## Components of Shareholders' Equity

Retained earnings are a part of shareholders' equity, referring to the proportion of net income not paid out to shareholders as dividends. Retained earnings can be viewed as savings, as they represent accumulated profits that have not been distributed. As companies continue to reinvest a portion of their earnings, retained earnings grow over time.

At times, accumulated retained earnings may exceed the capital contributed by shareholders. For companies that have been operating for many years, retained earnings typically constitute the largest portion of shareholders' equity.

Treasury stock refers to shares that a company repurchases from existing shareholders (not to be confused with U.S. Treasury bonds). Stock buybacks may occur when management cannot invest all available capital at optimal returns. Repurchased shares become treasury stock, and their value is recorded in an account called "Treasury Stock," which is contra to the investor capital and retained earnings accounts. Companies can reissue treasury shares to shareholders when they need financing.

Many consider shareholders' equity to represent a company's net assets, in other words, the amount shareholders would receive after liquidating all assets and paying off all debts.

## Shareholders' Equity Example

In its 2023 annual report, Apple Inc. reported shareholders' equity of $73.812 billion. This value consists of common stock and additional paid-in capital. Out of the 50 million shares authorized, the company has issued approximately 15.5 million shares.

Apple has also engaged in other types of shareholders' equity activities. As of September 30, 2023 (the date shown in the company's annual report), the company had an accumulated deficit of $214 million. Additionally, the company reported $11.1 billion in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

In Apple's 2023 report, the company listed shareholders' equity at $62.146 billion, an increase from $50.672 billion in the previous year.

## Other Forms of Equity

The concept of equity extends beyond company valuation. More broadly, equity can be considered as the degree of ownership in any asset after deducting all associated debts.

Here are several common variants of equity:

- Stocks or any other securities representing ownership interests in a company.
- On a company's balance sheet, the amount consisting of funds contributed by owners or shareholders plus retained earnings (or losses). This can also be called shareholders' equity.
- The value of securities in a margin account minus the amount borrowed from the brokerage firm by the account holder for margin trading.
- In real estate, the difference between the current fair market value of a property and the amount of mortgage still owed by the homeowner. This is the amount the homeowner would receive after selling the property and paying off any liens, also known as "real property value."
- When a business goes bankrupt and needs to be liquidated, equity is the amount remaining after paying off debts. Commonly referred to as "owner's equity," also known as risk capital or "venture capital."

## Private Equity

For a public company, the market value of equity can be easily obtained by looking at its stock price and market capitalization. For private companies, market mechanisms do not exist, so other forms of valuation must be used to estimate their value.

Private equity generally refers to the valuation of unlisted companies. The equity stated in the balance sheet is still the amount remaining after subtracting liabilities from assets, which can be used to estimate book value. Then, privately held companies can seek investors by directly selling shares. These private equity investors may include pension funds, university endowments, insurance companies, or qualified individuals.

Private equity is typically sold to funds and investors who specialize in direct investments in private companies or participate in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) of public companies. In an LBO transaction, companies obtain loans from private equity firms to finance the acquisition of a division of another company. The cash flow or assets of the acquired company usually serve as collateral for the loan. Mezzanine debt is a type of private loan typically provided by commercial banks or mezzanine venture capital firms. Mezzanine transactions usually involve a mix of debt and equity in the form of subordinated loans or the issuance of warrants, common stock, or preferred stock.

Private equity plays a role at different stages of a company's life cycle. Typically, young enterprises with uncertain revenue or earnings cannot take on borrowing and must obtain capital from friends, family, or individual angel investors. Venture capitalists only step in when the company has finally created a product or service and is ready for market. In the technology sector, some of the largest and most successful companies, such as Google, Apple, Amazon, and Meta, started with venture capital funding.

Venture capitalists (VCs) provide most private equity financing in exchange for early minority stakes. Sometimes, venture capitalists take board seats in their portfolio companies to ensure active involvement in guiding the company. Venture capitalists hope to achieve massive early returns and exit their investments within five to seven years. LBOs are a common type of private equity financing that typically occurs during a company's mature stage.

Another form of private equity is Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE). PIPEs involve private investment firms, mutual funds, or other qualified investors purchasing company stock at a discount to current market value to raise funds.

Unlike stockholder equity, private equity is not accessible to ordinary individuals. Only "qualified" investors, those with net worth of at least $1 million, can participate in private equity or venture capital partnerships. Depending on their size, such activities may require filing Form 4. For investors who don't meet this criterion, there is the option of investing in private equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

## Home Equity

Home equity can be roughly compared to the value contained in home ownership. A person's equity in their residence represents the value of the house they fully own after deducting mortgage debt. The equity in a property or residence comes from mortgage repayments, including the down payment and increases in property value.

Home equity is typically the largest source of collateral for individuals, which owners can leverage to obtain home equity loans, sometimes called second mortgages or Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOC). Equity extraction is the process of withdrawing funds or borrowing against the property.

For example, suppose Sam owns a mortgaged house. The current market value of the house is $175,000, with $100,000 remaining on the mortgage. Sam has $75,000 in equity in the house, calculated as $175,000 (total assets) - $100,000 (total liabilities).

## Brand Equity

When evaluating equity in assets, especially for large companies, it's important to note that these assets may include both tangible assets (such as real estate) and intangible assets (such as company reputation and brand identity). After years of advertising and customer base development, a company's brand may possess inherent value. This value is referred to as "brand equity," which measures the value of a brand relative to generic or store-brand products.

For example, many beverage enthusiasts prefer to purchase Coca-Cola rather than store-brand cola when buying drinks because they prefer its taste or are more familiar with it. If a bottle of store-brand cola sells for $1 and a bottle of Coca-Cola sells for $2, then Coca-Cola's brand equity is $1.

Negative brand equity is also possible, where people are willing to pay more for generic or store-brand products rather than products from a specific brand. Negative brand equity is relatively rare and usually results from poor public relations, such as product recalls or catastrophic events.

## Difference between Equity and Return on Equity

Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing net income by shareholders' equity. Since shareholders' equity equals company assets minus liabilities, it can be viewed as the return on net assets. ROE is considered a measure of how effectively management uses company assets to generate profits.

As mentioned earlier, equity has multiple meanings but typically represents ownership in an asset or company, such as shareholders having equity in a company. ROE is a financial metric that measures the profit generated from a company's shareholders' equity.

## Equity and Financial Accounting

The basic accounting equation states that assets equal the sum of liabilities and equity. This equation forms the foundation of the balance sheet, which summarizes a company's financial position at a specific point in time. In all examples discussed in this article, the calculation of equity is rooted in this fundamental accounting equation.

Liabilities are obligations to external parties, such as loans, accounts payable, and accrued expenses. Equity represents the residual claim on assets after satisfying liabilities. A company can finance an expense either through debt (i.e., liabilities) or with its own funds (i.e., equity). Thus, the equation reflects the principle that all of a company's resources (assets) can be financed through one of these two methods.

## What is Equity in Finance?

Equity is an important concept in finance, and its specific meaning varies depending on context. The most common type of equity is likely "shareholders' equity," which is calculated by subtracting a company's total liabilities from its total assets.

Therefore, shareholders' equity is essentially the company's net assets. In the event of liquidation, shareholders' equity represents the theoretical amount that would be returned to shareholders.

## What are other terms used to describe equity?

Other terms that describe this concept sometimes include shareholders' equity, book value, and net asset value. Depending on the context, the specific meanings of these terms may vary, but generally, they refer to the remaining investment value after paying off all liabilities associated with the investment. In real estate investment, this term is also used to refer to the difference between a property's fair market value and the outstanding mortgage value.

## How Do Investors Use Equity?

Equity is a very important concept for investors. For example, when examining a company, investors may use shareholders' equity as a benchmark to determine whether a purchase price is expensive. If the company has historically traded at a market-to-book ratio of 1.5, investors might think twice before paying above this valuation, unless they believe the company's prospects have fundamentally improved. On the other hand, investors might be willing to buy shares of an underperforming company at a relatively low price, as long as the price they pay is low enough relative to equity.

## How to Calculate Equity?

Equity equals total assets minus total liabilities. These figures can be found on a company's balance sheet. For homeowners, equity is the value of the house minus any outstanding mortgages or liens.

## Conclusion

Financial equity represents ownership rights to a company's assets after deducting liabilities. It reflects the value that belongs to shareholders or business owners. Equity can also refer to other items, such as brand assets or other non-financial concepts.
