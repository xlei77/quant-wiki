## What is Inflation?

Inflation refers to the gradual loss of purchasing power, manifested as a general increase in prices of goods and services over time.

The inflation rate is calculated as the percentage increase in the average price of a selected basket of goods and services over a one-year period. High inflation means prices are rising rapidly, while low inflation means prices are rising more slowly. Inflation is the opposite of deflation, which refers to falling prices and increasing purchasing power.

### Main Content

- Inflation measures the rate at which prices of goods and services increase.
- Inflation is sometimes categorized into three types: demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation.
- The most commonly used inflation indices are the Consumer Price Index and the Wholesale Price Index.
- Inflation can be viewed as either positive or negative, depending on one's perspective and the rate of change.
- Those who own tangible assets (such as real estate or stockpiled commodities) may welcome a certain degree of inflation as it increases the value of their assets.

## How Inflation Affects Consumers

While it's easy to measure price changes of individual products over time, human needs aren't limited to just one or two products. Individuals require a large and diverse range of products and services to live comfortably. These include commodities like food grains, metals, and fuel, utilities such as electricity and transportation, as well as services like healthcare, entertainment, and labor.

Inflation aims to measure the overall impact of price changes across diverse products and services. It allows for expressing the growth in the price level of goods and services throughout the economy during a specific period as a single value.

Rising prices mean that one unit of currency can buy fewer goods and services. This loss of purchasing power affects the cost of living for ordinary people, ultimately leading to slower economic growth. Economists generally believe that sustained inflation occurs when a country's money supply grows faster than its economic growth.

**3.4%:** Over the 12 months ending April 2024, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 3.4% on an unadjusted basis. In April 2024, prices rose 0.3% from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis.[1]

To address this, monetary authorities (in most cases, central banks) take necessary measures to manage money supply and credit to keep inflation within acceptable limits and maintain economic stability.

Theoretically, monetarism is a popular theory that explains the relationship between inflation and the economy's money supply. For example, after Spain's conquest of the Aztec and Inca empires, large quantities of gold and silver flowed into Spanish and other European economies. The rapid increase in money supply led to a decrease in currency value, resulting in rapid price increases.[2]

Inflation can be measured in various ways depending on the types of goods and services. It is the opposite of deflation, which indicates a general decrease in prices when the inflation rate falls below 0%. Remember that deflation should not be confused with disinflation, a related term referring to the slowdown in the (positive) inflation rate.

## What Causes Inflation

The increase in money supply is the root cause of inflation, although this can work through different mechanisms in the economy. A country's money supply can be increased by monetary authorities through:

- Printing more money and giving it to citizens
- Legal devaluation (reduction in value) of fiat currency
- Injecting new money into circulation as reserve account credit through the banking system by purchasing government bonds from banks in the secondary market (the most common method)
- Supply bottlenecks and shortages of key commodities, leading to price increases elsewhere.

In all these cases, money eventually loses its purchasing power. These mechanisms driving inflation can be categorized into three types: demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation.

Demand-pull inflation occurs when increases in money and credit supply stimulate aggregate demand for goods and services to grow faster than the economy's production capacity. This increases demand and leads to price rises.

When people have more money, it leads to positive consumer sentiment. This, in turn, leads to higher spending, which pulls prices higher. It creates a demand-supply gap with higher demand and lower supply flexibility, resulting in higher prices.

Cost-push inflation is the result of price increases through production process inputs. When increases in money and credit supply are channeled into commodity or other asset markets, prices of various intermediate goods rise. This is particularly evident when the supply of key commodities is affected by negative economic shocks.

These developments lead to higher costs for final products or services and ultimately result in higher consumer prices. For example, when money supply expands, it can create speculative booms in oil prices. This means energy costs may rise and lead to consumer price increases, which is reflected in various inflation measures.

Built-in inflation is related to adaptive expectations, or people's expectation that current inflation rates will continue in the future. As prices of goods and services rise, people may expect continued increases at similar rates in the future.

Consequently, workers may demand higher costs or wages to maintain their standard of living. Their increased wages lead to higher costs for goods and services, and this wage-price spiral continues to exist because one factor induces the other and vice versa.

## How to Protect Your Finances During Inflation

Individuals can take a series of measures to protect their finances against inflation.

For example, one can choose to invest in asset classes that outperform the market during inflationary periods. These may include commodities such as grains, beef, oil, electricity, and natural gas. Commodity prices typically lead product prices by one step, and rising commodity prices are often seen as indicators of future inflation. However, commodities can also be highly volatile and susceptible to natural disasters, geopolitical events, or conflicts.

Real estate income can also help buffer against inflation, as landlords can raise rents to keep pace with overall price increases.

The U.S. government also offers Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which are securities linked to inflation and designed to protect against declining purchasing power.

## Types of Price Indices

Based on the selected collection of goods and services, various types of commodity baskets are calculated and tracked as price indices. The most commonly used price indices are the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).

CPI is a measure of the weighted average price of a basket of goods and services that primarily represent consumer needs. These include transportation, food, and healthcare.

CPI is calculated by taking the price changes of each item in a predetermined basket of goods and averaging them according to their relative weights in the entire basket. The prices considered are retail prices of each item available for purchase by individual citizens. CPI affects the value of one currency relative to currencies of other countries.

Changes in CPI are used to evaluate price changes related to the cost of living, making it one of the most commonly used statistics for identifying periods of inflation or deflation. In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports the CPI monthly and has calculated it retroactively to 1913. [3]

**Important Note:** CPI-U was introduced in 1978 and represents the buying habits of approximately 88% of the non-institutional population in the United States. [4]5

WPI is another popular measure of inflation. It measures and tracks price changes of goods at stages before the retail level.

While WPI items vary by country, they primarily include items at the producer or wholesale level. For example, it includes cotton prices for raw cotton, cotton yarn, unprocessed cotton fabric, and cotton garments. [6]

Although many countries and organizations use WPI, many others, including the United States, use a similar variant called the Producer Price Index (PPI). [7]

PPI is a family of indices that measures the average change in selling prices received by domestic producers for their intermediate goods and services. PPI measures price changes from the seller's perspective, in contrast to CPI, which measures price changes from the buyer's perspective. [8]

In all variants, a price increase in one component (such as oil) may partially offset a price decrease in another component (such as wheat). Overall, each index represents the weighted average price change of given components, which may apply at the economy-wide, sector, or commodity level.

## Formula for Measuring Inflation

The aforementioned price index variants can be used to calculate inflation values between two specific months (or years). While many ready-to-use inflation calculators are available on various financial portals, it's always best to understand the underlying methodology to ensure calculation accuracy and clear comprehension. Mathematically,

Suppose you want to know how the purchasing power of $10,000 changed between January 1975 and January 2024. Price index data can be found in tabular form on various portals. From this table, select the corresponding CPI figures for the given two months. September 1975 was 52.1 (initial CPI value), and January 2024 was 308.417 (final CPI value). [9]10

Applying the formula:

To find out what $10,000 from January 1975 would be worth in January 2024, simply multiply the inflation rate by the amount to get the changed dollar value:

This means that $10,000 from January 1975 would be worth $59,197 today. Essentially, if you purchased a basket of goods and services worth $10,000 in 1975 (as defined in the CPI), it would cost you $59,197 to buy the same basket of goods and services in January 2024.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Inflation

Inflation can be interpreted as either good or bad, depending on which side people stand on and how quickly the changes occur.

Individuals who own tangible assets priced in their domestic currency (such as real estate or stockpiled commodities) may welcome a certain degree of inflation because it increases the price of their assets, which they can sell at higher prices.

Inflation typically leads businesses to speculate on risky projects and individuals to invest in company stocks, as they expect returns better than inflation.

An optimal level of inflation is usually advocated to encourage consumption rather than savings to some extent. If the purchasing power of money decreases over time, there may be a greater incentive to consume now rather than save and consume later. This may increase spending, thereby promoting a country's economic activity. It is believed that a balanced approach is to maintain inflation values within an optimal and ideal range.

Buyers of such assets may be dissatisfied with inflation because they will be asked to pay more money. People holding assets denominated in domestic currency (such as cash or bonds) may dislike inflation because it erodes the real value of their holdings.

Therefore, investors wishing to protect their portfolios from inflation should consider asset classes that hedge against inflation, such as gold, commodities, and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Inflation-indexed bonds are another popular option for investors to profit from inflation.

High and variable inflation rates can impose significant costs on the economy. Businesses, workers, and consumers must all consider the impact of generally rising prices in their purchasing, selling, and planning decisions.

This introduces an additional source of uncertainty to the economy, as they may incorrectly guess future inflation rates. The time and resources used to study, estimate, and adjust economic behavior are expected to rise to the general level of prices. This contrasts with real economic fundamentals, which inevitably represent costs to the entire economy.

Even low, stable, and easily predictable inflation rates that some consider optimal can lead to serious economic problems. This is due to how, where, and when new money enters the economy.

Whenever new money and credit enter the economy, it is always in the hands of specific individuals or businesses. The price level's adjustment process to new money supply occurs as they subsequently spend the new money, and the new money circulates through the economy from one hand to another, from one account to another.

Inflation indeed pushes up some prices first, then others later. This sequential change in purchasing power and prices (known as the Cantillon Effect) means that inflation not only raises the general price level over time. But it also distorts relative prices, wages, and rates of return along the way.[11]

Economists generally believe that relative prices deviating from their economic equilibrium is detrimental to the economy, and Austrian economists even consider this process to be the main driver of economic recession cycles.[12]

#### Advantages

- Results in higher resale value of assets
- Optimal level of inflation encourages consumption

#### Disadvantages

- Buyers must pay more for products and services
- Brings higher prices to the economy
- Drives up some prices first, then leads to increases in other prices

- Results in higher resale values for assets
- Optimal level of inflation encourages consumption

- Brings higher prices to the economy
- Drives up some prices first, then leads to increases in other prices

## How to Control Inflation

Financial regulatory authorities in a country bear the important responsibility of controlling inflation. This is accomplished through the implementation of monetary policy measures, which refers to actions taken by central banks or other committees to determine money supply and growth rates.

In the United States, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy objectives include moderate long-term interest rates, price stability, and maximum employment. Each of these goals aims to promote a stable financial environment. The Fed clearly communicates its long-term inflation target to maintain a stable long-term inflation rate, which is considered beneficial for the economy.

Price stability or relatively stable inflation levels allow businesses to plan for the future because they know what to expect. The Fed believes this will promote maximum employment, which is determined by non-monetary factors that fluctuate over time and therefore changes.

Consequently, the Fed does not set specific targets for maximum employment, which is primarily determined by employer assessments. Maximum employment does not mean zero unemployment, as there will always be some degree of fluctuation as people leave jobs and start new ones at any given time.[13]14

**Note:** Hyperinflation is typically described as periods when monthly inflation rates reach 50% or higher.[15]

Monetary authorities also take unconventional measures in extreme economic conditions. For example, after the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve maintained interest rates near zero and implemented a bond-buying program called Quantitative Easing (QE).[16]

Some critics of the program claimed it would lead to soaring dollar inflation, but inflation peaked in 2007 and steadily declined over the next eight years. There are many complex reasons why QE did not lead to inflation or hyperinflation, but the simplest explanation is that the recession itself was a very prominent deflationary environment, and QE counteracted its effects.[17]18

As a result, U.S. policymakers try to maintain inflation rates at around 2% annually. The European Central Bank (ECB) has also adopted aggressive QE policies to combat deflation in the Eurozone, with some areas even experiencing negative interest rates. This is due to concerns that deflation could spread throughout the Eurozone and lead to economic stagnation.[19]20

Furthermore, countries with higher growth rates can absorb higher inflation rates. India targets approximately 4% (with an upper limit of 6% and a lower limit of 2%), while Brazil targets 3.25% (with an upper limit of 4.75% and a lower limit of 1.75%).[21]22

## The Meaning of Inflation, Deflation, and Disinflation

While a high inflation rate means prices are rising, a low inflation rate does not mean prices are falling. Counter to intuition, when the inflation rate decreases, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace than before. When the inflation rate decreases (but remains positive), this is called disinflation.

Conversely, if the inflation rate becomes negative, it means prices are falling. This is called deflation and can have negative effects on the economy. Since purchasing power increases over time, consumers have less incentive to spend in the short term, leading to reduced economic activity.

## Hedging Inflation

Stocks are considered the best inflation hedging tool because stock price increases incorporate the effects of inflation. Since the increase in money supply in almost all modern economies is achieved through the injection of bank credit via the financial system, the direct impact on prices primarily occurs in financial assets denominated in domestic currency, such as stocks.

There are special financial instruments that people can use to protect investments against inflation. These include Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), which are low-risk government bonds linked to inflation, where the principal amount invested increases by the percentage of inflation.[23]

People can also opt for TIPS mutual funds or TIPS-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). To access stocks, ETFs, and other funds that can help avoid inflation risks, you may need a brokerage account. Choosing a stockbroker can be a tedious process due to differences between brokers.

Gold is also considered an inflation hedge, although historically, this has not always been the case.

## Examples of Inflation

Since all world currencies are fiat currencies, the money supply can increase rapidly for political reasons, leading to rapid rises in price levels. The most famous example is the hyperinflation that struck Germany's Weimar Republic in the early 1920s.

The victorious nations of World War I demanded reparations from Germany, which could not be paid in German paper currency because its value was suspect due to government borrowing. Germany attempted to print paper money, use it to purchase foreign currency, and then use the foreign currency to repay the debt.

This policy led to a rapid devaluation of the German mark accompanied by hyperinflation. German consumers responded to this cycle by spending their money as quickly as possible, understanding that the longer they waited, the less their money would be worth. More money flooded into the economy and its value plummeted to the point where people would use nearly worthless banknotes to wallpaper their homes. Similar situations occurred in Peru in 1990 and in Zimbabwe between 2007 and 2008.[24]2526

## What are the causes of inflation?

Inflation has three main causes: demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation.

- Demand-pull inflation refers to situations where production of goods or services cannot meet demand, leading to price increases.
- On the other hand, cost-push inflation occurs when the costs of producing goods and services rise, forcing businesses to increase prices.
- Built-in inflation (sometimes called the wage-price spiral) occurs when workers demand higher wages to keep up with rising costs of living. This in turn leads businesses to raise prices to offset increasing wage costs, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of wage and price increases.

## Is Inflation Good or Bad?

Excessively high inflation is generally considered detrimental to the economy, while too low inflation is also considered harmful. Many economists advocate for a middle ground of low to moderate inflation, approximately 2% per year.

Generally, higher inflation hurts savers because it erodes the purchasing power of their saved money; however, it can benefit borrowers because the inflation-adjusted value of their outstanding debt shrinks over time.

## What are the Effects of Inflation?

Inflation affects the economy in multiple ways. For example, if inflation causes a country's currency to depreciate, this can benefit exporters by making their export goods more affordable when priced in foreign currencies.

On the other hand, this can harm importers as it makes foreign-manufactured goods more expensive. Higher inflation also encourages consumption, as consumers rush to purchase goods before prices rise further. Conversely, savers may see the real value of their savings eroded, limiting their ability to consume or invest in the future.

## Why Is Current Inflation So High?

In 2022, inflation rates worldwide rose to their highest levels since the early 1980s. While there isn't a single cause for the rapid rise in global prices, a series of events collectively pushed inflation to such high levels.[27]28

The COVID-19 pandemic led to lockdowns and other restrictions that severely disrupted global supply chains, from factory closures to bottlenecks at shipping ports. Governments also issued stimulus checks and increased unemployment benefits to address the financial impact on individuals and small businesses. When vaccines became widely available and the economy rebounded, demand (partly driven by stimulus funds and low interest rates) quickly exceeded supply, which was still struggling to return to pre-COVID levels.

Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 led to economic sanctions and trade restrictions against Russia, limiting the world's oil and natural gas supply, as Russia is a major producer of fossil fuels. Food prices also rose as Ukraine's substantial grain harvests couldn't be exported. As fuel and food prices increased, it led to similar increases throughout the value chain. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates to combat high inflation, which declined significantly in 2023 but remained above pre-pandemic levels.[29]9

## Bottom Line

Inflation is the rise in prices, which leads to a decline in purchasing power over time. Inflation is a natural phenomenon, and the U.S. government targets a 2% annual inflation rate; however, it can be dangerous when inflation grows too quickly and too much.

Inflation makes goods more expensive, especially when wages don't rise at the same level as inflation. Additionally, inflation erodes the value of certain assets, particularly cash. Governments and central banks attempt to control inflation through monetary policy.
