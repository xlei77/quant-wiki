## What is the Underlying Asset

An underlying asset refers to the financial asset upon which a derivative's price is based. Options are an example of derivatives. A derivative is a financial instrument whose price is based on another asset.

## Basic Knowledge of Underlying Assets

The underlying asset gives value to derivatives. For example, options on XYZ stock give the holder the right to buy or sell XYZ at the strike price before expiration. The underlying asset for this option is XYZ stock. Many stocks (but not all) have option chains.

The underlying asset can be used to identify items that provide value to contracts in a protocol. The underlying asset supports the securities involved in the protocol, which both parties agree to exchange as part of a derivative contract.

## Understanding Derivative Contracts

The price of options or futures contracts derives from the price of the underlying asset. In an options contract, the seller must buy or sell the underlying asset to the buyer at an agreed price on a specified date. The buyer has no obligation to purchase the underlying asset but can exercise their right if they choose to do so. If the option is approaching expiration and the underlying asset hasn't moved favorably enough to make exercising the option worthwhile, the buyer can let the option expire and lose the amount they paid for the option.

Futures are obligations for both buyers and sellers. The seller of a futures contract agrees to deliver the underlying asset at expiration, while the buyer of the contract agrees to purchase the underlying asset at expiration. The price they receive and pay, respectively, is the price at which they entered the futures contract. Most futures traders close their positions before expiration, as retail traders and hedge funds rarely need to physically own barrels of oil, for example. However, they can buy or sell contracts at one price and, if prices move favorably, exit the trade for a profit. Futures are derivatives because, for example, the price of an oil futures contract is based on movements in oil prices.

### Key Takeaways

- The underlying asset represents the asset from which derivatives derive their value.
- Understanding the value of the underlying asset helps traders determine appropriate actions (buy, sell, or hold) for its derivatives.

## Examples of Underlying Assets

In the case of stock options, the underlying asset is the stock itself. For example, for a stock option to buy 100 shares of Company X at $100, the underlying asset is Company X's stock. The underlying asset is used to determine the option's value before expiration. The value of the underlying asset may change before the contract expires, thus affecting the option's value. The value of the underlying asset at any given time lets traders know whether the option is worth exercising.

The underlying asset can also be a currency or a market index, such as the S&P 500 index. In terms of stock indices, the underlying asset consists of common stocks in the stock market index.
