## What is Venture Capital (VC)?

Venture Capital (VC) is a form of private equity and a financing method provided to startups and small businesses that demonstrate long-term growth potential. Venture capital typically comes from investors, investment banks, and financial institutions. Venture capital can also be provided in the form of technical or managerial expertise.

### Key Points

- Venture Capital (VC) is a form of private equity and a financing method for startups and small businesses with long-term growth potential.
- Venture capitalists provide support through financing, technical expertise, or management experience.
- Venture capital firms raise funds from Limited Partners (LPs) to invest in promising startups and even larger venture capital funds.

## Understanding Venture Capital (VC)

VC provides financing for startups and small companies that investors believe have enormous growth potential. Financing typically comes in the form of private equity (PE), selling ownership to a small number of investors through separate limited partnerships (LPs). While venture capital tends to focus on emerging companies, private equity typically funds mature companies seeking equity injection. VC is an important source of fundraising, especially if startups cannot access capital markets, bank loans, or other debt instruments.[1]

Harvard Business School Professor Georges Doriot is generally considered the "Father of Venture Capital." He founded the American Research and Development Corporation in 1946 and raised a $3.58 million fund to invest in companies commercializing technologies developed during World War II.[2][3] The firm's first investment was in a company aiming to use X-ray technology for cancer treatment. Doriot's $200,000 investment turned into $1.8 million when the company went public in 1955.[3]

VC became synonymous with the growth of tech companies in Silicon Valley on the West Coast. By 1992, 48% of all investment capital flowed to West Coast companies, while Northeast industries accounted for only 20%.[4] In 2022, West Coast companies represented over 37% of all deals, while the Mid-Atlantic region accounted for only about 24% of all deals.[5]

## Types of Venture Capital

- Pre-Seed Funding: This is the earliest stage of business development, where founders attempt to turn an idea into a concrete business plan. They may participate in business accelerators to obtain initial funding and guidance.
- Seed Funding: This is when new ventures seek to launch their first product. Since there is no revenue stream yet, the company will need VC to fund all operations.
- Early-Stage Funding: Once a business develops its product, it will need additional capital to increase production and sales before it can become self-funding. The business will then need one or more rounds of funding, typically denoted incrementally as Series A, Series B, etc.

**$285 Billion:** The amount raised by VC-backed companies globally in 2023. [6]

## How to Obtain VC Funding

- Submit Business Plan: Any company seeking venture capital must submit a business plan to venture capital firms or angel investors. The firm or investor will conduct due diligence, which includes a thorough investigation of the company's business model, products, management, and operational history.
- Investment Commitment: After completing due diligence, the firm or investor will commit investment capital in exchange for equity in the company. These funds can be provided all at once, but more commonly are distributed in rounds. The firm or investor then takes an active role in the portfolio company, advising and monitoring its progress before releasing additional funds.
- Exit: Investors exit the company after a period, typically four to six years after initial investment, through initiating a merger, acquisition, or Initial Public Offering (IPO).

**Important Note:** Many venture capitalists have prior investment experience, often as equity research analysts. VC professionals tend to focus on specific industries. For example, a venture capitalist specializing in healthcare might have previous experience as a healthcare industry analyst.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Venture Capital

Venture capital provides funding for new enterprises that don't have sufficient cash flow to take on debt. This arrangement can be mutually beneficial, as businesses receive the capital needed to start operations while investors gain equity in promising companies. VCs typically provide mentorship and networking services to help find talent and advisors. Strong VC backing can translate into further investment.

However, businesses accepting venture capital support may lose creative control over their future direction. VC investors may demand a significant portion of company equity, and they may impose requirements on company management. Many VCs are simply seeking quick, high-multiple returns and may force rapid exits.

#### Advantages

- VC-backed guidance and networking services can help new companies acquire talent and grow

#### Disadvantages

- Requires a large portion of company equity
- Companies may find themselves losing creative control as investors demand immediate returns
- VCs may force companies to exit rather than pursue long-term growth

## Angel Investors

Venture capital can be provided by High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs), who are also commonly known as angel investors, or venture capital firms. The American Venture Capital Association is an organization composed of venture capital firms that fund innovative enterprises.[7]

Angel investors are typically a diverse group who have accumulated wealth through various sources. However, they are often entrepreneurs themselves or recently retired executives from business empires. Most seek to invest in well-managed companies that have fully developed business plans and are poised for significant growth.

These investors may also provide funding to businesses operating in industries or business areas they are familiar with or similar to their experience. Another common phenomenon among angel investors is co-investment, where an angel investor funds a business together with a trusted friend or colleague (often another angel investor).

## Success of Venture Capital

Due to the industry's proximity to Silicon Valley, the vast majority of venture capital-backed deals occur in the technology sector—internet, healthcare, computer hardware and services, and mobile and telecommunications. In 2023, San Francisco still ranked highest in VC investment.[8] Other industries have also benefited from VC funding, including Staples and Starbucks (SBUX).

Google and Intel both have venture capital funds to invest in emerging technologies.[9][10] In 2019, Starbucks also announced a $100 million venture capital fund to invest in food startups.[11] As VC has matured over time, the industry includes various types of participants and investors who invest in different stages of startup development.

## Why is Venture Capital Important?

New enterprises are typically high-risk and capital-intensive ventures. Therefore, external capital is usually needed to spread the risk of failure. As compensation for taking on this risk through investment, investors in new companies can acquire equity and voting rights for pennies on the potential dollar. Thus, venture capital enables startups to get off the ground and allows founders to realize their vision.

## What is Late-Stage Investment?

Late-stage financing has become increasingly popular as institutional investors prefer to invest in companies with lower risk profiles rather than early-stage companies with higher risks of failure.[12]

## How Did Regulatory Changes Promote the Development of VC?

The Small Business Investment Act (SBIC) of 1958 promoted the development of the VC industry by providing tax incentives to investors. In 1978, the Revenue Act was amended to reduce the capital gains tax from 49% to 28%.[13] In 1979, a change to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) allowed pension funds to invest up to 10% of their assets in small or new enterprises.[14] In 1981, the capital gains tax was further reduced to 20%.[15] These developments catalyzed the growth of VC, turning the 1980s into a boom period for venture capital, with funding levels reaching $4.9 billion in 1987.[16]

## Conclusion

Venture capital represents a core part of a new enterprise's lifecycle. Before a company begins generating revenue, it needs startup capital to hire employees, lease facilities, and begin product design. This funding is provided by VCs in exchange for a portion of equity in the new company.
