## What is a Bond?

A bond is a fixed-income investment instrument where individuals lend money to governments or companies at a specific interest rate for a fixed period. The borrowing entity repays the principal and interest to the bondholder at maturity.

Bonds are widely used by corporations, municipal authorities, state governments, and national governments to finance projects and operations. Bondholders are creditors of the issuer. Bond details include the maturity date, which is the date when the principal amount should be paid to the bondholder, and typically also include terms for fixed or floating interest payments that the borrower must make.

### Key Points

- Bonds are called fixed-income instruments because they typically pay fixed interest or coupons to creditors.
- Bond prices have an inverse relationship with interest rates: when interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa.
- Bonds have maturity dates by which the principal must be repaid in full, otherwise they face default risk.

## Bond Operating Mechanisms

Bonds are debt instruments that represent loans made to issuers. Bonds enable individual investors to play the role of lenders. Governments and corporations typically use bonds to borrow money to fund infrastructure such as roads, schools, and dams. Companies often borrow to expand operations, purchase property and equipment, undertake profitable projects, conduct research and development, or hire employees.

Bonds are fixed-income securities and represent one of the major asset classes for individual investors, alongside stocks and cash equivalents. A borrower issues a bond that includes loan terms, how interest will be paid, and the bond principal that must be repaid at maturity. Interest payments are part of the return that bondholders receive for lending to the issuer. The interest rate that determines the payment amount is called the coupon rate.

Most bonds are initially priced at their face value (i.e., $1,000 per bond). The actual market price of a bond depends on the issuer's credit quality, length of time to maturity, and how the coupon rate compares to the general interest rate environment. The face value is the amount paid to the lender when the bond matures.

**Note:** The market allows lenders to sell bonds to other investors or purchase bonds from other individuals—this typically occurs long after the original issuance organization's financing. Bond investors do not need to hold bonds until their maturity date.

## Bond Characteristics

- Face Value or Par Value: The value of the bond at maturity, and the reference amount used by the bond issuer to calculate interest payments.
- Coupon Rate: The interest rate that the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage.
- Coupon Dates: The dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments.
- Maturity Date: The date when the bond matures, at which time the bond issuer will pay the face value to the bondholder.
- Issue Price: The price at which the bond issuer initially sells the bond. In many cases, bonds are issued at par value.

## Bond Classification

There are four main categories of bonds in the market. However, you may also see foreign bonds issued by global corporations and governments on certain platforms.

- Corporate Bonds: Companies issue corporate bonds instead of seeking bank loans for debt financing because the bond market offers more favorable terms and lower interest rates.
- Municipal Bonds: Issued by state and municipal authorities. Some municipal bonds offer tax-exempt coupon income to investors.
- Government Bonds: Bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. Those with maturities under one year are called "Bills," those with maturities between one and ten years are called "Notes," and government bonds with maturities over ten years are called "Long-term Bonds." All bonds issued by the government Treasury are generally referred to as "Treasury Securities."
- Agency Bonds: Bonds issued by government-related organizations such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are considered agency bonds.

## Bond Prices and Interest Rates

Bond prices change daily, with supply and demand determining the observed prices. If investors hold bonds until maturity, they will receive the principal plus interest. However, bondholders can sell their bonds in the open market, where prices fluctuate. Bond prices move inversely to interest rates. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall to equalize the bond's yield with prevailing market rates, and vice versa.

Fixed-rate bond issuers promise to pay coupons based on the bond's face value. For example, for a $1,000 bond with a 10% annual interest rate, the issuer pays the bondholder $100 per year. If market interest rates are also 10% when this bond is issued, investors have no particular preference between investing in corporate bonds or government bonds, as both provide a $100 return. However, if interest rates fall to 5%, investors can only get $50 from government bonds while still receiving $100 from corporate bonds.

Investors will bid up the bond price until it trades at a premium that equals the current interest rate environment. At this point, the bond will trade at $2,000, making the $100 coupon equivalent to 5%. Similarly, if interest rates spike to 15%, investors can get $150 from government bonds and won't be willing to pay $1,000 to earn just $100. The bond will be sold until its price reaches a level where yields are equal, which would be $666.67.

## Yield to Maturity (YTM)

Yield to Maturity (YTM) refers to the total expected return if a bond is held until maturity. YTM is considered the yield of a long-term bond but is expressed as an annual rate.

YTM is the internal rate of return for an investor who holds a bond to maturity and receives all payments on schedule. YTM is used to evaluate a bond's attractiveness relative to other bonds in the market with different coupons and maturities. The calculation of YTM involves finding the interest rate.

Investors can measure the expected impact of interest rate changes on bond prices through the bond's duration. Duration indicates the change in a bond's price when interest rates change by 1%. This practical definition is known as the bond's modified duration. Bonds with longer maturities or lower coupons are most sensitive to interest rate changes.

## Bond Variants

Investors can choose from various types of bonds, depending on interest rates or coupon payment types, whether they can be called back by the issuer, or other characteristics.

- Zero-coupon bonds (Z-bonds): These bonds do not pay coupons but are issued at a price below their face value, with the full face value paid to bondholders at maturity. U.S. Treasury bonds are zero-coupon bonds.
- Convertible bonds: A debt instrument that includes an embedded option allowing bondholders to convert the debt into stock (equity) under certain conditions.
- Callable bonds: These have an embedded option but differ from convertible bonds. Callable bonds can be "called back" by the company before maturity. For bond buyers, callable bonds carry higher risk because the likelihood of being called increases when the bond's value rises.
- Putable bonds: Allow bondholders to sell the bond back to the company before maturity. This is valuable for investors who are concerned about potential bond depreciation or believe interest rates will rise and want to recover their principal before the bond loses value. Putable bonds typically trade at higher prices than bonds without put options but with the same credit rating, maturity, and coupon rate, as they offer more value to bondholders.

## Determinants of Bond Coupon Rates

Two characteristics of bonds—credit quality and time to maturity—are the main factors determining bond coupon rates. If the issuer has a lower credit rating, the default risk is higher, and therefore these bonds pay higher interest rates. Bonds with longer maturities typically also pay higher interest rates. This higher compensation is due to bondholders facing greater interest rate and inflation risks over a longer period of time.

## How is Bond Rating Conducted?

Credit ratings for companies and their bonds are generated by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's (S&P), Moody's, and Fitch Ratings. The highest quality bonds are referred to as "investment grade," which includes debt issued by the U.S. government and some very stable corporations (such as many utility companies). Debt that is not considered investment grade but has not defaulted is known as "high yield" or "junk" bonds. These bonds carry a higher risk of future default, and investors demand higher coupon payments to compensate for this risk.

## What is Duration?

As interest rates change, the value of bonds and bond portfolios rises and falls. The sensitivity to changes in the interest rate environment is called "duration." The use of the term duration in this context might confuse new bond investors, as it does not refer to the length of time until the bond matures. Instead, duration describes the magnitude by which bond prices rise or fall in response to interest rate changes.

## Final Summary

Bonds are instruments issued by companies and governments to finance projects and operations. Since bonds traditionally pay fixed interest rates to creditors, they are considered fixed-income instruments. Investors can purchase corporate bonds through financial institutions or online brokers, or government bonds through the U.S. Treasury website.
