## What is Volatility?

Volatility is a statistical measure used to gauge the dispersion of returns for a specific security or market index. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. Volatility is typically measured using the standard deviation or variance of returns for the same security or market index.[1]

In securities markets, volatility is often associated with large swings in either direction. For example, when the stock market experiences rises and falls of more than 1% over a sustained period of time, it is called a volatile market. An asset's volatility is a key factor in the pricing of options contracts.

### Main Content

- Volatility represents the magnitude of asset price fluctuations around the average price—it is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns.
- There are several methods to measure volatility, including beta coefficient, option pricing models, and standard deviation of returns.
- Volatile assets are generally considered riskier than less volatile assets because price predictability is lower.
- Implied volatility measures expected future market volatility, while historical volatility measures price changes over a specified time period.
- Volatility is a crucial variable in calculating option prices.

## Understanding Volatility

Volatility typically refers to the magnitude of uncertainty or risk associated with changes in a security's value. Higher volatility means that a security's value can potentially be spread out over a larger range of values. This means that the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction in a short period of time. Lower volatility means that a security's value does not fluctuate dramatically and tends to be more stable.

One way to measure an asset's volatility is to quantify the asset's daily returns (daily percentage changes). Historical volatility, based on historical prices, represents the degree of variability in asset returns.[1] This number is unitless and expressed as a percentage.[2]

While variance captures the overall dispersion of asset returns around the mean, volatility is a measure of variance over a specific time period. Therefore, we can report daily, weekly, monthly, or annualized volatility. As such, it is useful to think of volatility as the annualized standard deviation.

## How to Calculate Volatility

Volatility is typically calculated using variance and standard deviation (standard deviation is the square root of variance). Since volatility describes changes over a specific time period, simply multiply the standard deviation by the square root of the number of periods in the time frame under discussion:

Where:

- σ = Standard deviation of returns
- T = Number of periods in the time range

For simplicity, let's assume we have monthly stock closing prices from $1 to $10. For example, the first month is $1, the second month is $2, and so on. To calculate the variance, follow these five steps.

In this case, the resulting variance is $8.25. Taking the square root gives us the standard deviation. This equals $2.87. This is a measure of risk that shows how values are distributed around the average price. It lets traders understand how much prices might deviate from the mean.

If prices were randomly drawn from a normal distribution, then approximately 68% of all data values would fall within one standard deviation. 95% of data values would fall within two standard deviations (2 × 2.87 in our example), and 99.7% of all values would fall within three standard deviations (3 × 2.87).

In this case, the values from $1 to $10 are not randomly distributed on a bell curve; instead, they are uniformly distributed. Therefore, the expected 68%–95%–99.7% percentages do not hold. Despite this limitation, traders frequently use standard deviation because price return datasets typically more closely resemble a normal (bell curve) distribution than the given example.

**Tip:** Stock price volatility is considered mean-reverting, meaning that periods of high volatility tend to moderate and periods of low volatility tend to increase, fluctuating around some long-term average.

## Types of Volatility

Implied Volatility (IV), also known as forecast volatility, is one of the most important indicators for options traders. As its name suggests, it enables them to determine how volatile the market will be in the future. This concept also provides traders with a method of calculating probabilities. An important point to note is that it should not be viewed as a science, and therefore it cannot predict future market movements.

Unlike historical volatility, implied volatility comes from the price of the options themselves and represents expectations of future volatility. Since it is implied, traders cannot use past performance as an indicator of future performance. Instead, they must estimate the potential of options in the market.[3]

**Note:** Implied volatility is a key characteristic of options trading.

Historical Volatility (HV), also known as statistical volatility, measures the volatility of the underlying security by measuring price changes over a predetermined time period. Compared to implied volatility, it is a less popular indicator because it is not forward-looking.[4]

When historical volatility rises, the security's price also fluctuates more than normal. At this point, people expect that something will or has already changed. On the other hand, if historical volatility decreases, it means that any uncertainty has been eliminated, and therefore everything returns to how it was before.

This calculation can be based on intraday changes, but typically measures variation based on changes from one closing price to the next closing price. Historical volatility can be measured in increments ranging from 10 to 180 trading days, depending on the expected duration of the options trade.

## Volatility and Option Pricing

Volatility is a key variable in option pricing models, used to estimate the degree of fluctuation in the underlying asset's returns between the current date and the option's expiration date. Volatility is expressed as a percentage coefficient in option pricing formulas, derived from daily trading activity. The method of measuring volatility will affect the value of the coefficient used.[5]

Volatility is also used to price option contracts using models such as Black-Scholes or binomial tree models.[6] An underlying asset with greater volatility will translate into higher option premiums, as increased volatility means there is a greater chance the option will end up in-the-money at expiration. Option traders attempt to predict future volatility of assets, and thus option prices in the market reflect their implied volatility.

**Important Note:** The greater the volatility, the higher the market price of the option contract.

## Other Measures of Volatility

One way to measure the relative volatility of a specific stock compared to the market is its beta (β). Beta approximates the overall volatility of a security's returns relative to the returns of a relevant benchmark (typically using the S&P 500 index). For example, based on price levels, a stock with a beta of 1.1 moved 110% for every 100% movement in the benchmark.

Conversely, a stock with a beta of 0.9 moved 90% for every 100% movement in the underlying index.[7]

Market volatility can also be observed through the Volatility Index (VIX), which is a numerical indicator measuring broad market volatility. The Chicago Board Options Exchange created the VIX as a measure of 30-day expected volatility in the U.S. stock market, derived from real-time quotes of S&P 500 call and put options.[8] It is effectively a measure of future bets that investors and traders are making on the direction of the market or individual securities. High VIX readings indicate higher market risk.

Traders can also trade the VIX using various options and exchange-traded products, or they can use VIX values to price certain derivatives.

## Tips for Managing Volatility

Investors may find periods of high volatility unsettling as prices can fluctuate dramatically or suddenly drop. Long-term investors are best advised to ignore short-term periods of volatility and stay the course. This is because over the long run, stock markets tend to rise. Meanwhile, emotions like fear and greed — which can be amplified in volatile markets — can derail your long-term strategy.

Some investors can also use volatility as an opportunity to add to their portfolios by buying on dips when prices are relatively cheap.

You can also use hedging strategies to deal with volatility, such as buying protective put options to limit downside losses without having to sell any stocks. However, note that put options also become more expensive when volatility is high.

## Volatility Example

Suppose an investor is building a retirement portfolio. Since she will retire in the coming years, she is looking for stocks with low volatility and stable returns. She is considering two companies:

A more conservative investor might choose Company ABC for their portfolio because it has lower volatility and more predictable short-term value.

## What is Volatility (Mathematically)?

Volatility is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree of dispersion of data around its mean over a given period. It is calculated as the standard deviation multiplied by the square root of the time period T. In finance, it represents this dispersion of market prices on an annualized basis.

## Are Volatility and Risk the Same?

Volatility is often used to describe risk, but this is not always the case. Risk involves the possibility of suffering losses, while volatility describes the magnitude and speed of price movements. If these increased price movements also increase the possibility of losses, then risk increases as well.

## Is Volatility a Good Thing?

Whether volatility is good or bad depends on what type of trader you are and your risk preferences. For long-term investors, volatility might mean trouble, but for day traders and options traders, volatility usually equals trading opportunities.

## What Does High Volatility Mean?

If volatility is high, it means that prices are moving rapidly and significantly (both up and down).

## What is VIX?

VIX is the Cboe Volatility Index, which measures short-term volatility in the broader market through the implied volatility of 30-day S&P 500 options contracts. VIX typically rises when stocks fall and falls when stocks rise. VIX is also known as the "fear index" and thus can measure market sentiment, with higher values indicating greater volatility and fear among investors.[8]

## Bottom Line

Volatility refers to the magnitude and speed of price movements within a given time span. In the stock market, increased volatility is often a sign of investor fear and uncertainty. This is why the VIX volatility index is sometimes called the "fear index."

Meanwhile, volatility can create opportunities for intraday traders to enter and exit positions. Volatility is also a key component in options pricing and trading.
