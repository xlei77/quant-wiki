## What is an Exchange Rate?

An exchange rate is the ratio at which one currency can be exchanged for another currency. It affects trade and capital flows between countries.

Exchange rates are influenced by the value of domestic currency and foreign currency. As of April 2024, the exchange rate between USD and EUR is 1.07, meaning it takes 1.07 USD to purchase 1 EUR.[1]

### Key Points

- Exchange rate is the rate at which one currency can be converted into another currency.
- Most exchange rates are defined as floating rates. They rise or fall based on supply and demand in the market.
- Some exchange rates are pegged or fixed to the currency value of specific countries.
- Exchange rate changes affect businesses as they alter the cost of supplies purchased from different countries and change overseas customers' demand for their products.

## Understanding Exchange Rates

Exchange rates between two currencies are typically determined by economic activities, market interest rates, GDP, and unemployment rates of respective countries. Commonly known as market exchange rates, they are set in global financial markets where banks and other financial institutions trade currencies around the clock based on these factors. Exchange rate changes can occur hourly or daily, ranging from small fluctuations to significant jumps.[2]

Exchange rates are usually expressed using abbreviations that represent national currencies. "USD" represents the US Dollar. "EUR" represents the Euro. When referring to the currency pair of US Dollar and Euro, it is written as EUR/USD.

**Important Note:** For the Japanese Yen, it is USD/JPY, meaning US Dollar against Japanese Yen. An exchange rate of 100 means 1 US Dollar equals 100 Japanese Yen.

## How Exchange Rates Fluctuate

Exchange rates can be either free-floating or fixed. Free-floating exchange rates rise and fall based on changes in the foreign exchange market. Fixed exchange rates are pegged to the value of another currency. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar within a range of 7.75 to 7.85, so the value of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar will stay within this range.[3]

Exchange rates have a spot rate or cash value, which is the current market value. They can also have forward values, which are based on expectations of whether the currency will rise or fall relative to its spot price.

Forward exchange rate values fluctuate based on changes in expectations of one country's future interest rates relative to another's. If traders speculate that the Eurozone will ease monetary policy while the US does the opposite, they might buy dollars against euros, leading to a downward trend in the euro's value.

## Exchange Rate Examples

A traveler going from the United States to Germany wants to exchange $200 USD for euros upon arrival in Germany. The selling rate is the price at which travelers sell foreign currency to receive local currency. The buying rate is the price at which foreign currency is bought back from travelers in exchange for local currency.

If the current exchange rate is 1.05, then $200 USD will net 190.48 euros. In this case, the equation is: USD รท exchange rate = EUR:

Suppose 66 euros remain at the end of the trip. If the exchange rate drops to 1.02, converting euros back to USD will yield $67.32:

Japanese yen calculations are different. In this case, USD comes before JPY, as in USD/JPY. The equation for USD/JPY is: USD x exchange rate = JPY.

If the exchange rate is 110, a traveler going to Japan who wants to exchange $100 USD for yen will receive 11,000 yen. To convert yen back to USD, divide the currency amount by the exchange rate:

## How Does Exchange Rate Affect Supply and Demand of Goods?

Exchange rate fluctuations affect businesses because they alter the cost of supplies purchased from different countries and change the demand for their products from overseas customers.

## What is the Foreign Exchange Market?

The foreign exchange market allows banks, funds, and individuals to buy, sell, or exchange currencies. The market operates 24 hours a day, 5 days a week, with daily trading activity worth trillions of dollars, as traders seek to profit by betting on the appreciation or depreciation of one currency's value relative to another.

## What is a Restricted Currency?

Exchange rates can vary within the same country. Some countries have restricted currencies, which limit their convertibility within their borders, and typically have both onshore and offshore exchange rates. More favorable rates can usually be found within a country than outside its borders, and the value of restricted currencies is set by the government.

China is an example of a country with this type of exchange rate structure and government-controlled currency. The Chinese government sets a daily reference rate (middle price) for the renminbi and allows it to trade within a 2% range above and below this middle price. [4]

## Conclusion

Exchange rates represent the ratio at which one currency can be converted into another currency. Most exchange rates are floating, rising or falling based on supply and demand relationships in the market, but some exchange rates are pegged to or fixed against the value of specific countries' currencies. Changes in exchange rates affect businesses and the cost of supplies in international markets as well as the demand for their products.
