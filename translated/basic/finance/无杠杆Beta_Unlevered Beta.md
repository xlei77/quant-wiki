## What is Unlevered Beta?

Beta is a measure of market risk. Unlevered Beta (or Asset Beta) measures a company's market risk without the influence of debt.

The "de-levered" Beta eliminates the financial impact of leverage, thereby isolating only the risk associated with the company's assets. In other words, it shows how much the company's equity contributes to its risk profile.

### Key Points

- Levered Beta (commonly abbreviated as Beta or Equity Beta) is a measure of market risk. When evaluating a company's risk profile, both debt and equity are considered.
- Unlevered Beta removes the debt component to isolate the risk solely attributable to company assets.
- High debt-to-equity ratios typically translate into increased risk associated with company stock.
- A Beta value of 1 indicates the stock has the same risk as the market, while Beta values greater than or less than 1 reflect risk thresholds above or below the market, respectively.

## Understanding Unlevered Beta

Beta is the slope coefficient of a stock's regression against a benchmark market index (such as the S&P 500). A key determinant of beta is leverage, which measures the ratio of a company's debt to equity. Levered beta measures the risk relative to market volatility when a company's capital structure includes both debt and equity. Another type of beta is known as unlevered beta.

An "unlevered" beta eliminates any favorable or unfavorable effects gained by adding debt to a company's capital structure. Comparing companies' unlevered betas allows investors to clearly understand the risk composition they are taking on when purchasing stocks.

$$ \text{无杠杆beta (资产beta)} =\frac{ \text{杠杆beta (权益beta)} } {\left( 1 + \frac{\left( 1-\text{税率} \right )*\text{债务}}{\text{权益}} \right )} $$

Consider a company that increases debt, thereby raising its debt-to-equity ratio. This will result in a larger proportion of earnings being used to service debt, thus intensifying investors' uncertainty about future earnings streams. Consequently, the company's stock is considered increasingly risky, but this risk does not stem from market risk.

**Tip:** Isolating and eliminating the debt portion from overall risk yields the unlevered beta.

A company's debt level affects its performance, making it more sensitive to stock price changes. Note that while the company being analyzed includes debt in its financial statements, unlevered beta treats it as if it had no debt, thus excluding any debt from the calculation. Since companies have different capital structures and debt levels, analysts can calculate unlevered beta to effectively compare them to each other or to the market. This way, only the sensitivity of the company's assets (equity) to the market is considered.

To "unlever" beta, one must know the company's levered beta, along with its debt-to-equity ratio and corporate tax rate.

## Systematic Risk and Beta

Systematic risk is a type of risk caused by factors beyond a company's control. This risk cannot be eliminated through diversification. Examples of systematic risk include natural disasters, political elections, inflation, and wars. Beta is used to measure the level of systematic risk or volatility of a stock or portfolio.

Beta is a statistical measure that compares the volatility of a stock's price to the volatility of the broader market. If a stock's volatility (as measured by Beta) is high, the stock is considered high-risk. If a stock's volatility is low, the stock is considered lower risk.

A Beta value of 1 equals the risk of the broader market. In other words, a company with a Beta of 1 has the same systematic risk as the broader market. A Beta value of 2 means the company is twice as volatile as the overall market, while a Beta value less than 1 means the company is less volatile and has less risk than the broader market.

## Unlevered Beta Example

For example, calculating Tesla's unlevered Beta (as of November 2017):

- beta (BL) is 0.73
- debt to equity (D/E) ratio is 2.2
- corporate tax rate is 35%

Unlevered Beta is almost always equal to or lower than levered Beta, because debt is typically zero or positive. (In rare cases, if a company's debt portion is negative, such as when a company hoards cash, the unlevered Beta might be higher than the levered Beta.)

If the unlevered Beta is positive, investors will invest in the company's stock when they expect prices to rise. A negative unlevered Beta will encourage investors to invest in the stock when they expect prices to fall.

## How Does Unlevered Beta Help Investors?

Unlevered Beta eliminates any favorable or unfavorable effects obtained by adding debt to a company's capital structure. Comparing companies' unlevered Betas allows investors to clearly understand the composition of risk they take on when purchasing stocks. Since companies have different capital structures and debt levels, investors can calculate unlevered Beta to effectively compare them with each other or with the market. This way, only the sensitivity of the company's assets (equity) to the market is considered.

## What is Beta?

In simple terms, Beta (ß) is a measure of market risk. More precisely, it is an indicator that measures the volatility (or systematic risk) of a security or portfolio relative to the overall market. In statistical terms, it is the slope coefficient of the regression of a security (stock) against a benchmark market index (S&P 500). Each data point represents a comparison between the return of an individual stock and the return of the entire market. Therefore, Beta effectively describes how a security's returns behave in response to market movements.

## What is Levered Beta?

Levered Beta measures a company's risk relative to market volatility when its capital structure includes both debt and equity. A key determinant of Beta is leverage, which measures the ratio of a company's debt to equity. Therefore, the Levered Beta of a publicly traded security measures that security's sensitivity relative to overall market performance. A Levered Beta greater than +1 or less than -1 indicates that it has greater volatility than the market. A Levered Beta between -1 and +1 indicates that it has less volatility than the market.
