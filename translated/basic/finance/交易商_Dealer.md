## What is a Dealer?

A dealer refers to individuals or companies who buy and sell securities for their own accounts, which can be done through brokers or other means. Dealers act as principal participants in trades, while brokers act as agents executing orders for clients.

Dealers play important roles in the market. They make markets in securities and underwrite securities, providing investment services to investors. This means dealers are market makers who provide the bid and ask quotes you see when looking up security prices in over-the-counter markets. Meanwhile, they help create market liquidity and drive long-term growth.

In the United States, dealers belong to a separate registration category, while in Canada, the term is typically shortened from "investment dealer" and is equivalent to broker-dealers in the US.

### Key Points

- Dealers buy and sell securities for their own accounts.
- Dealers play an important role in the market as market makers, creating liquidity and facilitating long-term market growth.
- Dealers must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and comply with all state requirements before beginning operations.
- Dealers differ from traders and brokers in that the former trade for their own accounts, while the latter do not trade for their own portfolios.
- Dealers are regulated by the SEC.

## Understanding Dealers

A dealer in the securities market is an individual or company who is prepared and willing to buy securities with their own funds (at bid price) or sell securities from their own account (at ask price). Dealers seek to profit from the spread between bid and ask prices while providing liquidity to the market. Dealers neither represent clients nor facilitate transactions between parties.

**Note:** Entities that arrange securities trading but do not purchase and hold securities in their own accounts are not classified as dealers.

Dealers are different from traders. Dealers buy and sell securities as part of their regular business, while traders buy and sell securities for their own accounts, not for commercial purposes.

In recent years, dealers' profitability has been challenged by various factors, including increased technological requirements to handle rapidly changing markets, industry consolidation, and an increasingly stringent regulatory environment, all of which have raised compliance costs.

## Dealer Regulation

Dealers are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of this regulation, all dealers and brokers must register with the SEC and become members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

Individuals engaging in the following activities typically need to register as dealers:

- Those who continuously hold themselves out as willing to buy and sell specific securities (i.e., making a market for that security).
- Those who operate a matched book of repurchase agreements.
- Individuals who issue or originate securities and simultaneously buy and sell these securities.

According to SEC guidance, dealers must fulfill certain duties when dealing with customers. These duties include executing orders promptly, disclosing material information and conflicts of interest to investors, and charging reasonable prices in the market.

Dealers may not commence business operations before their SEC registration is approved. They must also join a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO), become members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and comply with all state requirements.

## Differences Between Dealers and Brokers

These two roles are typically associated with the buying and selling of securities. Although they can function similarly to some extent, there are distinct differences.

Unlike dealers, brokers do not trade for their own portfolio but rather facilitate trades by bringing buyers and sellers together. In practice, most dealers also act as brokers and are therefore called broker-dealers. Broker-dealers range in size from small independent firms to subsidiaries of large banks. Companies acting as broker-dealers perform both services depending on market conditions and the size and type of securities involved in specific transactions.

Another key difference between the two is how they charge fees. Dealers charge markups when selling from their own inventory, as dealers are principals in their accounts, while brokers charge commissions when executing trades for clients.

**Important Note:** Dealers are different from Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs), who have a duty to put their clients' interests ahead of their own. This standard is known as the fiduciary standard.

## Dealer Market

A dealer market refers to an environment where multiple dealers gather to buy and sell securities for their own accounts. In this market, dealers can trade with each other and complete transactions using their own fundsâ€”this differs from a broker market, where they act as agents between buyers and sellers. Brokers are not permitted to trade in the dealer market. Dealers provide all trading terms, including prices.

## Dealers in Other Markets

While the term "dealer" is predominant in securities markets, this distinction is also used in other fields. A dealer can also refer to a business or individual engaged in trading or buying and selling specific products or services. For example, someone who sells cars is called a car dealer, while those engaged in antique sales are known as antique dealers.

## Dealer Common Q&A

After purchasing securities such as stocks and bonds, dealers sell these securities to other investors at prices higher than their purchase prices. The difference between their purchase price (bid price) and selling price (ask price) is called the dealer's spread. The dealer's spread equals the profit earned by the dealer in the transaction.

When you open an account with a broker-dealer, you typically need to provide certain types of information.

Before opening an account with anyone, you should check the broker's background and disciplinary history. The SEC's website provides guidance on finding a broker's background or disciplinary record.

Broker-dealers typically ask clients for the following personal information:

- Name
- Social Security number (or taxpayer identification number)
- Address
- Phone number
- Email address
- Date of birth
- Driver's license, passport information, or other government-issued identification information
- Employment status and occupation
- Whether employed by a brokerage firm
- Annual income
- Net worth
- Investment objectives and risk tolerance

You also need to decide what type of brokerage account to open. Broker-dealers typically offer two types of accounts: cash accounts and margin accounts.

Finally, you need to make some investment decisions for your account. You can also choose to grant "discretionary authority" to someone else to make decisions for your account.

According to FINRA data, there are over 3,400 securities firms. Some of the largest broker-dealers include Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab, and Edward Jones.

Broker-dealers can be individuals or companies (general partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, corporations, or other entities). According to the latest data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), there are over 3,400 broker-dealers to choose from.

## Conclusion

A dealer is an individual or company that buys and sells securities for their own account, whether through brokers or other means. Dealers are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Dealers are important because they make markets in securities, underwrite securities, and provide investment services to investors.
