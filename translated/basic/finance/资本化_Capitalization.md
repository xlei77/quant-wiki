## What is Capitalization?

Capitalization is an accounting method that incorporates costs into the value of an asset and allocates these costs over the asset's useful life, rather than expensing them directly in the period when they are incurred. Capitalization treats cash expenditures as assets that appear on the balance sheet, rather than as expenses that show up on the income statement.

Capitalization can also refer to the quantitative assessment of a company's capital structure, including the cost of capital in the form of stocks, long-term debt, and retained earnings.

### Key Points

- In accounting, capitalization allows assets to be depreciated over their useful life and reflected on the balance sheet, rather than on the income statement.
- Capitalization can refer to either book value or a company's total debt and equity.
- Undercapitalized companies do not have sufficient funds to meet all obligations.

## Types of Capitalization

- Accounting: The matching principle requires companies to record expenses in the same accounting period as the related revenue occurs. However, assets may benefit a business over multiple accounting periods, typically fixed assets such as office buildings. The costs of these items are recorded in the general ledger as the historical cost of the asset. Therefore, these costs are capitalized rather than expensed. Capitalized assets are not fully expensed in the current accounting period. A company can make large purchases but spread the expense over multiple years depending on the type of property, plant, or equipment involved.

- Finance: Capitalization can refer to the book value capital cost, which is the sum of a company's long-term debt, stock, and retained earnings. An alternative to book value is market value, which depends on the company's stock price. Market capitalization is the number of outstanding shares multiplied by the share price. If the total number of outstanding shares is one billion and the current share price is $10, the market capitalization is $10 billion. Companies with high market capitalization are known as large-cap stocks.

**Important Note:** Since assets are used over time to generate revenue for the company, a portion of their cost is allocated to each accounting period. This process is known as depreciation for fixed assets and amortization for intangible assets.

## Capitalization Threshold

Typically, a company sets a "capitalization threshold." If cash expenditures exceed this amount and it's appropriate, capitalization will occur. Companies set capitalization thresholds because materiality varies by size and industry. For example, a small local store might set a capitalization threshold of $500, while a global technology company might set its capitalization threshold at $100,000.

When costs are incorrectly capitalized or expensed, financial statements can be manipulated. If costs are incorrectly expensed, net income for the period will be lower than it should be, and the company will pay lower taxes in the current period. If costs are incorrectly capitalized, net income for the period will be higher than it should be. Additionally, assets on the balance sheet will be overstated.

## What is the difference between undercapitalization and overcapitalization?

Companies may experience either overcapitalization or undercapitalization. Undercapitalization refers to when earnings are insufficient to cover the cost of capital, such as interest payments to bondholders or dividend payments to shareholders. Overcapitalization, on the other hand, refers to a situation where external capital is not needed due to good profitability, while earnings are undervalued.

## How Does Capitalization Affect Leased Equipment?

For leased equipment, capitalization involves classifying lease assets as purchased assets, converting operating leases into capital leases, thereby reflecting the leased assets as one of the company's assets on the balance sheet. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires all leases exceeding twelve months to be capitalized as assets and recorded as liabilities in the lessee's books to reflect the rights and obligations of the lease.[1]

## What Expenses Can Be Capitalized?

Expenses that can bring benefits to future periods should be capitalized, so that the expenses of the assets can be recognized in the same period when the benefits are received. Generally, examples of expenses that can be capitalized include development costs, construction costs, or capital assets such as equipment or vehicles.

## Summary

In accounting, capitalization refers to long-term assets with future benefits. It transforms cost expensing into depreciation over time, allowing expenses to be recognized when benefits are realized. In finance, capitalization refers to a company's financing structure and its book value cost of capital.
