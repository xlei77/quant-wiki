## What is Present Value?

Present Value (PV) is the current value of a future sum of money or series of cash flows. Its calculation is based on discounting the future value using an estimated rate of return. If this money is invested, the discount rate represents the potential rate of return it could earn. Present value calculations are significant in both investment and corporate strategic planning.

### Key Points

- Present Value (PV) is based on the concept that a certain amount of money today is typically worth more than the same amount in the future because it can be invested and earn returns during that period.
- Present value calculations require estimating the potential rate of return, known as the discount rate.
- Since the discount rate can only be estimated, if the estimation is inaccurate, the present value calculation results will also be incorrect.
- Investors can also calculate Future Value (FV) by applying the estimated rate of return to today's value.

## Understanding Present Value

The concept of present value holds that a specific amount of money today is typically worth more than the same amount in the future, known as the time value of money. Conversely, a future receivable amount is usually worth less than that amount today.

For example, $1,000 today should be worth more than $1,000 five years from now, because today's $1,000 can be invested and earn returns over these five years. Assuming an annual return rate of 5%, with compound interest calculated yearly, this $1,000 would grow to approximately $1,276 in five years.

The calculation of present value works in reverse. If you are to receive $1,000 in five years (future value FV), how much is that money worth today? Using the same annual return rate of 5%, the answer is approximately $784. In this formula, the return rate is called the discount rate. The term "discount" refers to converting future value to present value.

## Present Value Formula and Calculation

The formula for calculating the present value of a future sum of money is as follows:

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{现值} = \dfrac{\text{未来价值}}{(1+r)^n}\\ &\textbf{其中：}\\ &\text{未来价值} = \text{FV}\\ &r = \text{回报率}\\ &n = \text{时间周期数}\\ \end{aligned} $$

To calculate the present value of a series of future cash flows, this formula needs to be repeated for each cash flow and then summed together. Fortunately, nowadays you can easily accomplish this using software or online calculators instead of calculating manually.

## Determining the Discount Rate

As mentioned earlier, the discount rate is the rate of return used in present value calculations. It represents the rate of return you forgo by choosing to receive an amount in the future rather than the same amount today. The discount rate is highly subjective, as it is merely an estimate of the return rate you might earn by investing today's funds over a period of time.

In many cases, investors typically choose the risk-free rate of return as the discount rate. This usually refers to the interest rate on U.S. Treasury bonds, as these bonds are considered virtually risk-free because they are backed by the U.S. government.

The higher the discount rate you choose, the lower the present value will be, because you are assuming you can earn a higher return on your funds.

## Benefits of Present Value

- Present value can clearly determine whether an investment's expected rate of return is sufficient to make it worth pursuing. Companies and investors typically set a hurdle rate, representing the minimum rate of return they need to achieve.
- Present value helps investors and companies make choices between different investments.

## Limitations of Present Value

- Present value requires assumptions about discount rates, which may not be accurate.
- Due to these assumptions, present value calculations can be manipulated by those advocating for specific investments, such as corporate managers promoting legacy projects.

**Note:** By using real interest rates instead of nominal rates, you can incorporate the potential effects of inflation into the present value formula.

## Present Value Example

As a simple example, suppose you can choose between receiving $2,000 today or $2,200 one year from now. You expect that you can safely invest the $2,000 and earn a 3% return. Which option is better?

In this case, $2,200 is the future value (FV), so the present value (PV) calculation is $2,200 ÷ (1 + 0.03)¹. The result is $2,135.92. Therefore, if you want to receive the payment now, you would need to receive at least $2,135.92 (not just $2,000) to break even.

## Calculating Future Value and Present Value

In the above present value formula, we assume you know the future value and need to calculate the present value.

When you know the present value, you can also calculate the future value using the following formula: FV = PV x (1 + r)n.

Using the same numbers from the previous example:

FV = 2000 × 1.03 = $2,060.

Looking at the calculation results of present value and future value, waiting for $2,200 after one year would be more profitable than $2,000 now.

Of course, the results of both calculations equally depend on whether your chosen rate of return is accurate.

## How to Calculate Present Value?

Present value is calculated using three data points: the expected future value, the interest rate that could be earned on the investment, and the number of payment periods, which would be 1 in the case of a one-year investment without compound interest.

Using this information, you can calculate the present value using the formula:

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{现值} = \dfrac{\text{FV}}{(1+r)^n}\\ &\textbf{其中：}\\ &\text{未来价值} = \text{FV}\\ &r = \text{回报率}\\ &n = \text{时间周期数}\\ \end{aligned} $$

## Present Value Example

Consider a scenario where you expect to receive a one-time payment of $5,000 in five years. If the discount rate is 8.25%, you want to know the value of this payment today. Therefore, you calculate the present value: $5,000 ÷ (1 + 0.0825)⁵ = $3,363.80.

## The Importance of Present Value

The importance of present value lies in enabling investors and businesses to determine whether certain future outcomes are worth investing in today. This is particularly crucial when selecting potential investments, especially those expected to generate returns at different points in the future.

## Conclusion

Present value is a method of expressing the current value of future funds or cash flows. While useful, it relies on making good assumptions about future rates of return, which become particularly complex over longer time periods.
