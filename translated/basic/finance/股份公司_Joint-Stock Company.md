## What is a Joint-Stock Company?

A joint-stock company is a business owned by its investors, where each investor owns a portion of the company's shares based on their investment amount. It is the predecessor of modern corporations and other types of registered companies in the United States.

Joint-stock companies were created to fund expensive ventures that neither individuals nor governments could afford on their own. The owners of joint-stock companies expected to share in their profits.

Today, American companies are not organized as joint-stock companies. While the term "joint-stock company" can be used to describe businesses with shareholders, no such registration option exists. Instead, businesses are organized as corporations, partnerships, or Limited Liability Companies (LLCs).

### Key Points Summary

- Joint-stock companies are the ancestors of modern corporations, despite legal differences.
- A joint-stock company is a business owned by its shareholders, who can freely trade their shares.
- Historically, shareholders of joint-stock companies might have had unlimited liability for company debts.
- In the United States, corporate registration limits shareholder liability to the par value of their shares.[1]
- The British East India Company is an example of a joint-stock company.

## Characteristics of Joint Stock Companies

Shareholders of joint stock companies have unlimited liability for company debts. In the United States, the legal process of incorporating as a corporation or LLC limits liability to the par value of stocks owned by shareholders or the capital contribution of LLC members.[1] In the United Kingdom, the term "limited" carries a similar meaning.[2]

Shares in joint stock companies are transferable. If the joint stock company is publicly listed, its shares will trade on registered stock exchanges. Shares of private joint stock companies can be transferred between parties, though the transfer process may be restricted by agreements (for example, limited to family members only).[1]

Historically, due to the unlimited liability nature of joint stock companies, shareholders' personal assets could be seized to repay debts in the event of company bankruptcy.[3]

## Types of Corporations

Companies register with state and local authorities to be legally permitted to conduct business in their chosen organizational form (e.g., Corporation, S-Corporation, Limited Liability Partnership, Limited Liability Company, etc.).

This is a company incorporated under a state royal charter. Chartered companies may possess certain privileges related to conducting business operations.

A statutory corporation is a company established by an act of the state legislature to provide public services beneficial to the people. The responsibilities and privileges of such a corporation are detailed in that act.

## Advantages of Joint-Stock Companies

- Joint-stock companies can raise substantial capital through numerous shareholders, which can be used to establish business operations.
- Shareholders have a direct say in decisions related to company management. They also have the right to elect the board of directors.
- Shares of listed companies can be freely bought and sold on stock exchanges. Shares of private companies can be traded according to company allowances or restrictions.
- Today's joint-stock companies offer shareholders limited liability for debts incurred by the company.
- If the company needs additional funds, it can issue new shares and bonds.
- For public companies, there is no limit on the number of shareholders (private companies may set such restrictions).
- Investment risk is spread among many shareholders rather than being borne by one or two individuals.
- Listed joint-stock companies support good corporate governance and make their externally audited financial statements available for public scrutiny.

**Note:** The Muscovy Company was a joint-stock company chartered by Queen Mary of England in 1555. Shareholders included explorer Sebastian Cabot and numerous London merchants. The company was granted exclusive rights to trade with Russia.

## Stock Companies and Listed Companies

Although a stock company is not a specific legal form of business entity in the United States, the term can be used to describe corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, or public companiesâ€”in fact, any company that has multiple shareholders.

Historically, stock companies were associated with unlimited liability and the possibility of seizing personal assets to repay outstanding debts. Modern public companies with shareholders are still stock companies, but their legal status limits shareholders' liability to their ownership/contribution amount.

## Brief History of Joint-Stock Companies

Records of joint-stock companies in Europe date back to the 13th century. However, they seemed to multiply from the 16th century onward, when adventurous investors began to speculate on opportunities discovered in the New World.[4]

The exploration of the Americas was primarily funded by joint-stock companies. National governments were eager to acquire new territories but were unwilling to bear the enormous costs and risks associated with these ventures.[4]

This prompted entrepreneurs to design a business plan. They would raise funds by selling shares of their ventures to numerous investors to finance voyages to the New World. The potential for developing resources and establishing trade appealed to many investors. Others wanted to acquire real estate in the New World and establish new communities free from religious persecution.[4]

In American history, the London Virginia Company was one of the earliest and most famous joint-stock companies. In 1606, King James I signed a royal charter granting the company exclusive rights to establish a colony in what is now Virginia. The Virginia Company's business plan was ambitious, ranging from developing the region's gold resources (which didn't actually exist) to finding a viable route to China (which also didn't exist).[4]

After many tribulations, the company successfully established the Jamestown colony in Virginia and began growing and exporting tobacco. However, in 1624, an English court ordered the dissolution of the company, and Virginia was transformed into a royal colony. The Virginia Company's investors never saw a profit.[4]

## Why Were Joint-Stock Companies So Important in American History?

Joint-stock companies played a crucial role in financing the settlement of the original colonies. These companies could raise funds from numerous investors without exposing any single investor to excessive risk. This enabled the companies to gather sufficient resources to successfully establish settlements in the New World. A notable example is the London Virginia Company, which financed the settlement of Jamestown.[4]

## Do Stock Companies Still Exist?

Yes. In the United States today, stock companies are known as corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies (LLCs). While there is no legal business registration form specifically labeled as "stock company," the term can be used to describe any business entity that issues shares and has shareholders.

## What are the advantages of joint-stock companies?

Joint-stock companies (both past and present) can raise substantial capital by issuing shares to individuals. This made them practical for risky ventures in colonial America that could not be funded by a single person or entity alone. Naturally, all shareholders expect to receive a portion of any returns proportional to their investment.

## How are Today's Joint-Stock Companies Different?

The legal liability that shareholders must bear is different. In the past, any shareholder could be held fully liable for debts owed and unpaid by the company. Shareholders' personal assets could be seized by creditors or authorities as payment. Today, shareholders' liability is typically limited to their investment in the company.

## What are some famous joint-stock companies?

The famous joint-stock company is the British East India Company, which was established for the purpose of trading with India and Asia. During its 250-year history, the EIC effectively controlled the colonization and exploitation of India and other overseas territories.[5]

## Bottom Line

A corporation is collectively owned by shareholders. Such companies have existed since the 13th century. Historically, they exposed shareholders to unlimited liability, which did not encourage investment.

Fortunately, corporate law limits shareholder liability. In the United States, it is limited to the par value of their shares.
