## What is Margin?

In finance, margin refers to the collateral that investors must deposit with brokers or exchanges to cover potential credit risk they may pose to the broker or exchange. Credit risk can arise when investors borrow cash from brokers to purchase financial instruments, borrow financial instruments for short selling, or enter into derivative contracts.

Margin buying refers to the practice of purchasing assets by borrowing from a broker. This type of purchase typically refers to the initial payment made by investors to brokers for assets; investors use marginable securities in their brokerage accounts as collateral.

In general business contexts, margin refers to the difference between a product or service's selling price and its production cost, or the ratio of profit to revenue. Margin can also refer to the interest rate component added to the adjustable index rate in an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM).

### Key Points

- Margin is funds borrowed from brokers to purchase investments, representing the difference between the total investment value and the loan amount.
- Margin trading refers to the practice of trading financial assets using funds borrowed from brokers, with these assets serving as collateral for the loan.
- A margin account is a standard brokerage account that allows investors to use cash or securities in the account as collateral for loans.
- The leverage effect obtained through margin typically amplifies both gains and losses. In the event of losses, brokers may force liquidation without prior consent.

## Understanding Margin and Margin Trading

Margin refers to the net equity in an investor's brokerage account. "Buying on margin" means purchasing securities using funds borrowed from a broker. This type of trading requires opening a margin account rather than a regular brokerage account. A margin account is one where the broker provides loans to investors so they can purchase more securities than their account balance would allow.

Using margin to purchase securities is essentially like using existing cash or securities in your account as collateral for a loan. This secured loan comes with a periodic interest rate that the investor must repay. Since the investor is using borrowed funds, both losses and gains are amplified. Margin investing can be advantageous if the investor expects to earn returns higher than the loan's interest rate on the investment.

For example, if your margin account has a 60% initial margin requirement and you want to purchase securities worth $10,000, your margin would be $6,000, with the remainder available to borrow from the broker.

**Important Note:** The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) states that margin accounts "can be very risky and are not suitable for everyone."[1]

## Operating Process

Margin buying is the process of borrowing money from a broker to purchase stocks. It can be viewed as a loan obtained from a brokerage firm. Margin trading allows you to purchase more stocks than you would normally be able to afford.

To engage in margin trading, you need a margin account. This differs from a regular cash account, where trades are made using cash in the account. In a margin account, you deposit cash that serves as collateral for loans to purchase securities. You can borrow up to 50% of the investment cost. Therefore, if you deposit $5,000, you will be able to purchase up to $10,000 worth of securities.

Your broker will charge interest on this loan that you use, which you need to repay on time. If you sell the securities, the proceeds will first go toward repaying the loan, and you can keep the remainder.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulate margin trading, specifying how much money you must deposit, how much you can borrow, and how much you must maintain in your account. [2]

## Components of Margin Trading

According to law, your broker must obtain your consent to open a margin account. A margin account may be part of your standard account opening agreement or a completely separate agreement. The minimum investment required to open a margin account is $2,000, though some brokerages may require a higher amount. This deposit is known as the minimum margin.[2]

Once the account is opened and operational, you can borrow up to 50% of the stock's purchase price. The portion of the purchase price you deposit is called the initial margin. It's important to know that you don't have to leverage the full 50%. You can choose to borrow less, such as 10% or 25%. Note that some brokerages require you to deposit more than 50% of the purchase price.[2]

As long as you pay the interest on your loan on time, you can maintain the loan. When selling stocks in a margin account, the proceeds are first used to repay the loan until it is fully paid off.

There's another restriction called the maintenance margin, which is the minimum account balance you must maintain to avoid your broker requiring you to deposit more funds or sell stocks to repay the loan. When this occurs, it's called a margin call. A margin call is effectively a demand from your brokerage firm to add more funds to your account or close positions to bring the account back to the required level. If you fail to meet the margin call requirements, your brokerage can close out any open positions without your consent to restore the account to its minimum value. Your brokerage has the freedom to choose which positions to liquidate.

Additionally, your brokerage may charge commissions on trades. You are responsible for any losses incurred during this period, and your brokerage may close out enough shares or contracts to exceed the initial margin requirement.

## Special Considerations

Using margin is a form of borrowing, which incurs costs, with marginable securities in your account serving as collateral. The primary cost is that you must pay interest on the loan. These interest charges are applied to your account unless you decide to repay them. Over time, the accruing interest causes your debt level to rise. As debt increases, interest charges increase. Therefore, margin purchases are primarily used for short-term investments. The longer you hold an investment, the higher the return rate needed to break even. If you hold margin investments for extended periods, the likelihood of profiting significantly decreases.

Not all stocks, ETFs, or other investment securities qualify for margin purchases. Additionally, not all exchanges or brokers allow margin trading on the investment products they handle. For example, margin trading on certain cryptocurrencies may be restricted.

The Federal Reserve Board regulates which stocks are marginable. [3] Generally, brokers won't allow clients to purchase penny stocks or initial public offerings (IPOs) on margin due to the inherent daily risks of these types of stocks. Individual brokerage firms can also decide not to offer margin on certain stocks, so verify the restrictions on your margin account with them.

**Note:** Large-scale margin calls can create a ripple effect on other investors. If a significant investor faces a substantial margin call, their forced liquidation may cause the value of collateral securities held by other margin traders to decline, potentially subjecting these investors to their own margin calls.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Margin Trading

#### Advantages

- Potential for greater returns due to leverage effect
- Increased purchasing power
- Generally more flexible than other types of loans
- May create a self-fulfilling opportunity cycle, where increased collateral value further enhances leverage opportunities

#### Disadvantages

- Leverage effect may lead to greater losses
- Generates account fees and interest charges
- May result in margin calls, requiring additional equity investment
- May lead to forced liquidation, resulting in securities sales (usually at a loss)

The main reason investors engage in margin trading is to utilize leverage. The core of margin trading is to enhance purchasing power by increasing available capital. Investors can use capital as loan collateral to purchase securities beyond their existing funds.

Therefore, margin trading can amplify profits. When holding more securities, increases in value yield greater results because you hold more investments in the form of debt. Additionally, if the value of securities held as collateral increases, you may further leverage as your collateral base expands.

Margin trading is typically more flexible than other types of loans, may not have fixed repayment schedules, and brokers' maintenance margin requirements may be simpler or automated. For most margin accounts, the loan remains open until securities are sold, at which point final payment typically becomes due from the borrower.

If investors primarily use margin trading to amplify returns, they must recognize that margin trading also amplifies losses. If the value of securities purchased on margin drops rapidly, investors may not only lose their initial equity investment but also need to pay additional funds to lenders. Margin trading also has costs; brokers typically charge interest fees, which accrue regardless of how well (or poorly) your margin account performs.

Because of margin and equity requirements, investors may face margin calls. This is the broker's requirement to deposit additional funds into the margin account when the equity value of securities holdings declines. Investors must remain highly vigilant to meet these additional capital requirements.

If investors cannot supplement additional equity, or if the account value falls too quickly, violating certain margin requirements, forced liquidation may occur. This forced liquidation will sell the purchased securities and may result in losses to meet the broker's requirements.

## Margin Example

Suppose you deposit $10,000 in a margin account. Because you pay 50% of the purchase price, this means you have $20,000 in buying power. Then, if you purchase $5,000 worth of stock, you still have $15,000 in buying power remaining. You have enough cash to pay for this trade and haven't used any margin yet. You only start borrowing when you purchase more than $10,000 worth of securities.

Please note that the buying power in a margin account changes daily based on price fluctuations of marginable securities.

## Other Uses of Margin

In business accounting, margin refers to the difference between revenue and expenses, where businesses typically track their gross margin, operating margin, and net profit margin. Gross margin measures the relationship between a company's revenue and the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Operating margin considers both the cost of goods and operating expenses compared to revenue, while net profit margin calculates all these expenses, taxes, and interest.

Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) offer a fixed rate for an initial period, after which the rate adjusts. To determine the new rate, banks add a margin to a specified benchmark index. Typically, the margin remains constant throughout the loan term, while the benchmark rate varies. To better understand this, consider an ARM with a 4% margin using a Treasury index as its benchmark. If the Treasury index is 6%, then the mortgage rate would be the 6% benchmark rate plus the 4% margin, totaling 10%. [4][5]

## What is Margin Trading?

Margin trading means borrowing money from a brokerage firm to conduct trades. In margin trading, investors first deposit cash as collateral for the loan, then pay ongoing interest on the borrowed funds. This loan increases the investor's purchasing power, enabling them to buy more securities. The purchased securities automatically serve as collateral for the margin loan.

## What is a Margin Call?

A margin call occurs when a broker, after providing a margin loan to an investor, issues a notice requiring the investor to increase the collateral in their margin account. When facing a margin call, investors typically need to deposit additional cash into their account, sometimes by selling other securities. If the investor refuses to do so, the broker has the right to forcibly liquidate the investor's positions to raise the required funds. Many investors worry about margin calls because they may be forced to sell positions at unfavorable prices.

## Are There Other Meanings of "Margin"?

Beyond margin lending, the term "margin" has other uses in finance. For example, it serves as an umbrella term for different profit ratios, such as gross margin, pre-tax margin, and net margin. The term is sometimes also used to refer to interest rates or risk premiums.

## What are the risks of margin trading?

In margin investing, investors face the risk of losses exceeding their deposits in the margin account. This can occur when the value of held securities declines, forcing investors to provide additional funds or undergo forced liquidation of securities.

## Summary

Investors looking to amplify potential gains and losses from trading may consider margin trading. Margin trading involves borrowing money, depositing cash as collateral, and using borrowed funds to trade. Through the use of debt and leverage, margin can lead to returns higher than what investors might achieve using only their own funds. On the other hand, if securities values decline, investors may risk owing more debt than their collateral.
