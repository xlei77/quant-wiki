## What is Macroeconomics?

Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of the overall economy, including markets, businesses, consumers, and governments. Macroeconomics examines phenomena that affect the entire economy, such as inflation, price levels, economic growth rates, national income, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and changes in unemployment rates.

Some key questions that macroeconomics studies include: What causes unemployment? What causes inflation? What creates or stimulates economic growth? Macroeconomics attempts to measure how an economy is performing, understand the forces driving it, and predict how its performance can be improved.

### Key Points

- Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that deals with the structure, performance, behavior, and decision-making of an entire or aggregate economy.
- The two main areas of macroeconomic study are long-term economic growth and short-term business cycles.
- Modern macroeconomics is typically defined as beginning with John Maynard Keynes and his theories about market behavior and government policy in the 1930s; several schools of thought have developed since then.
- In contrast to macroeconomics, microeconomics focuses more on the impacts and choices of individual actors in the economy (such as individuals, companies, and industries).

## Understanding Macroeconomics

As the name suggests, macroeconomics is a field that analyzes the economy from a broad perspective. This includes examining variables such as unemployment rates, GDP, and inflation. Additionally, macroeconomists develop models to explain the relationships between these factors.

These models and their resulting predictions are used by government entities to help construct and evaluate economic, monetary, and fiscal policies. Businesses use these models to formulate strategies for domestic and global markets, while investors use them to predict and plan for movements across various asset classes.

When properly applied, economic theory can illuminate how the economy works and the long-term consequences of specific policies and decisions. Macroeconomic theory can also help individual businesses and investors make better decisions by understanding more thoroughly how broad economic trends and policies affect their own industries.

## History of Macroeconomics

Although the term "macroeconomics" can be traced back to the 1940s, many core concepts in the field have been studied for much longer. Since the discipline's inception in the 18th century, topics such as unemployment, prices, growth, and trade have puzzled economists. Some elements in the early works of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill addressed issues that would now be considered within the domain of macroeconomics.

Modern macroeconomics is typically defined as beginning with John Maynard Keynes and his 1936 publication "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money." In the book, Keynes explained the consequences of the Great Depression, when goods went unsold and workers were unemployed.

**Note:** Throughout the 20th century, Keynesian economics (i.e., Keynes's theories) evolved into several other schools of thought.

Before the popularization of Keynesian theory, economists typically did not distinguish between microeconomics and macroeconomics. The same microeconomic laws of supply and demand operating in individual commodity markets were understood to interact between individual markets to bring the economy to general equilibrium, as described by LÃ©on Walras.

The connection between commodity markets and large-scale financial variables such as price levels and interest rates was explained through money's unique role as a medium of exchange in the economy, by economists including Knut Wicksell, Irving Fisher, and Ludwig von Mises.

## Macroeconomics vs. Microeconomics

Macroeconomics differs from microeconomics, which focuses on smaller factors that influence individual choices. Individuals are typically divided into several subgroups, such as buyers, sellers, and business owners. These actors interact according to the laws of supply and demand, using money and interest rates as coordinating pricing mechanisms. The factors studied in microeconomics and macroeconomics often influence each other.

A key distinction between microeconomics and macroeconomics is that macroeconomic aggregates sometimes behave in very different ways or even opposite to similar microeconomic variables. For example, Keynes mentioned the so-called paradox of thrift, which recognizes that individuals save money to accumulate wealth at the microeconomic level. However, when everyone tries to increase savings simultaneously, this can lead to economic slowdown and reduce wealth at the overall macroeconomic level. This occurs because spending decreases, affecting business revenues and reducing worker compensation.

## Limitations of Macroeconomics

It is equally important to understand the limitations of economic theories. Theories are often created in a vacuum, lacking specific real-world details such as taxes, regulations, and transaction costs. The real world is also absolutely complex, including issues like social preferences and conscience, which do not lend themselves well to mathematical analysis.

**Important Note:** In economic theory and discussions, you'll frequently encounter the phrase "ceteris paribus," which roughly translates to "all other things being equal." Economists use this phrase to focus on specific relationships between variables under discussion while assuming all other variables remain constant.

Despite the limitations of economic theory, tracking important macroeconomic indicators (such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment rates) remains important and valuable. This is because companies' performance, and their stocks, are significantly influenced by the economic conditions in which they operate.

Similarly, understanding which theories are currently in favor, and how they might influence specific government administrative departments, can be extremely valuable. These economic theories can indicate how governments will handle taxation, regulation, government spending, and similar policies. By better understanding economics and the consequences of economic decisions, investors can at least glimpse possible futures and act accordingly with confidence.

## Schools of Macroeconomic Thought

The field of macroeconomics is organized into several different schools of thought, each holding different views on how markets and their participants operate.

Classical economists believe that prices, wages, and interest rates are flexible and that markets tend to clear unless prevented by government policies; these ideas build upon Adam Smith's original theories. "Classical economists" is not actually a school of macroeconomic thought but rather a label first used by Karl Marx and later by Keynes to refer to earlier economic thinkers with whom they disagreed.

Keynesian economics, primarily based on the work of John Maynard Keynes, marks the beginning of macroeconomics as a field of study separate from microeconomics. Keynesians focus on aggregate demand as the primary factor in issues such as unemployment and business cycles.

Keynesian economists believe that business cycles can be managed through active government intervention, specifically through fiscal policy, where government increases spending during recessions to stimulate demand or reduces spending during expansions to decrease demand. They also believe in monetary policy, where central banks stimulate lending by lowering interest rates or restrict lending by raising them.

Keynesian economists also believe that certain rigidities in the system, particularly sticky prices, prevent proper clearing of supply and demand.

Monetarism, a branch of Keynesian economics, is primarily credited to Milton Friedman's work. Monetarists work within and extend the Keynesian model, believing that monetary policy is typically a more effective and desirable policy tool than fiscal policy for managing aggregate demand. However, monetarists also recognize limitations in monetary policy that make fine-tuning the economy unwise, favoring instead adherence to policy rules that promote stable inflation rates.

New Classical economists, along with New Keynesians, primarily build on incorporating microeconomic foundations into macroeconomics to resolve apparent theoretical contradictions between the two disciplines.

New Classical economists emphasize the importance of microeconomics and models based on that behavior. New Classical economists assume all agents attempt to maximize their utility and have rational expectations, which they incorporate into macroeconomic models. New Classical economists believe that unemployment is largely voluntary, that discretionary fiscal policy is destabilizing, and that inflation can be controlled through monetary policy.

The New Keynesian school also attempts to add microeconomic foundations to traditional Keynesian economic theory. While New Keynesians accept that households and firms operate based on rational expectations, they still believe various market failures exist, including sticky prices and wages. Due to this "stickiness," government can improve macroeconomic conditions through fiscal and monetary policy.

The Austrian School is an older school of economics experiencing a revival in popularity. Austrian economic theory primarily applies to microeconomic phenomena. However, like the so-called classical economists, they never strictly distinguished between microeconomics and macroeconomics.

Austrian theory has important implications for other theories considered macroeconomic. In particular, Austrian Business Cycle Theory explains broadly synchronized (macroeconomic) fluctuations in market activity due to monetary policy and the role of money and banking in connecting (microeconomic) markets to each other and across time.

## Macroeconomic Indicators

Macroeconomics is a fairly broad field, but two specific areas of study dominate the discipline. The first area focuses on factors determining long-term economic growth. The other area examines the causes and consequences of short-term fluctuations in national income and employment, also known as the business cycle.

Economic growth refers to the increase in an economy's total output. Macroeconomists try to understand the factors that promote or hinder economic growth to support economic policies that will foster development, progress, and improved living standards.

Economists can use many indicators to measure economic performance. These indicators are divided into 10 categories: 1

- GDP indicators: measure the economy's output
- Consumer spending indicators: measure how much capital consumers feed back into the economy
- Income and savings indicators: measure consumer income and savings
- Industry performance indicators: measure GDP by industry
- International trade and investment indicators: show balance of payments between trading partners, trade volume, and international investment volume
- Price and inflation indicators: show fluctuations in prices paid for goods and services and changes in currency purchasing power
- Fixed asset investment indicators: show how much capital is locked in fixed assets
- Employment indicators: show employment by industry, state, county, and other regions
- Government indicators: show government spending and revenue
- Special indicators: include all other economic indicators, such as personal income distribution, global value chains, healthcare spending, small business well-being, etc.

Superimposed on long-term macroeconomic growth trends, the levels and rates of change of important macroeconomic variables such as employment and national output experience fluctuations. These fluctuations are known as expansion, peak, recession, and troughâand they occur in that order. When plotted on a chart, these fluctuations indicate that businesses operate in a cyclical manner; hence, it is called the business cycle.

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) measures the business cycle, which uses GDP and national income to determine cycle dates. [2] NBER is also the institution that announces the beginning and end of recessions and expansions.

## How to Influence Macroeconomics

Since macroeconomics is such a broad field, actively influencing the economy is challenging and requires more time than changing individual behaviors in microeconomics. Therefore, an economy needs an entity dedicated to studying and identifying techniques that can influence large-scale changes.

In the United States, the Federal Reserve is the central bank tasked with promoting maximum employment and price stability. These two factors have been identified as key to positively influencing changes at the macroeconomic level.

To influence change, the Fed implements monetary policy through tools it has developed over the years, designed to impact its dual mandate. It can use the following tools:3

- Federal Funds Rate Range: A target range set by the Fed that guides overnight lending rates between depository institutions to facilitate short-term borrowing
- Open Market Operations: Buying and selling securities in the open market to alter the supply of reserves
- Discount Window and Rate: Lending to depository institutions to help banks manage liquidity
- Reserve Requirements: Maintaining reserves to help banks maintain liquidity
- Interest on Reserve Balances: Encouraging banks to hold reserves for liquidity and paying them interest for doing so
- Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Facility: A supplementary tool to help control the federal funds rate by selling securities and repurchasing them the next day at a more favorable price
- Term Deposit Facility: Term deposits of reserves used to drain reserves from the banking system
- Central Bank Liquidity Swaps: Establishing swap lines with central banks from specific countries to improve liquidity conditions in both U.S. and participating central banks
- Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility: A facility for institutions to enter into repurchase agreements with the Fed as a liquidity backstop
- Standing Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement Facility: A tool to encourage or discourage borrowing above a set rate, which helps control the effective federal funds rate

The Fed continuously updates its tools for influencing the economy, and it maintains a list of many other tools it has used previously that could be implemented again if needed.[4]

## What is the Most Important Concept in Macroeconomics?

It is said that the most important concept in macroeconomics is output, which refers to the total quantity of goods and services produced by a country. Output is typically considered a snapshot of the economy at a specific point in time.

## What are the 3 main concerns of macroeconomics?

The three main macroeconomic concerns are unemployment levels, inflation, and economic growth.

## Why is Macroeconomics Important?

Macroeconomics helps governments evaluate economic performance and determine what actions they can take to increase or slow down growth.

## Bottom Line

Macroeconomics is a field of study used to evaluate overall economic performance and formulate actions that can positively influence the economy. Economists work to understand how specific factors and actions affect output, input, spending, consumption, inflation, and employment.

The study of economics began long ago, but the field didn't begin to evolve into its current form until the 1700s. Macroeconomics now plays a crucial role in government and business decision-making.
