## What is Money Velocity?

Money velocity measures the rate at which money exchanges hands in an economy. It is the number of times money transfers from one entity to another. Money velocity also refers to the degree to which a unit of currency is used within a given time period. Simply put, it is the speed at which consumers and businesses in an economy collectively spend money.

Money velocity is typically measured as the ratio of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to a country's M1 or M2 money supply. The term "velocity" here refers to the speed at which money changes hands.

### Key Points

- Money velocity measures the rate at which money exchanges hands in an economy.
- Money velocity is calculated by dividing GDP by the money supply.
- The money velocity formula shows how quickly one unit of money supply is used for transactions of goods and services in an economy.
- Money velocity tends to be higher in expanding economies and lower in contracting economies.

## Understanding Money Velocity

Money velocity is crucial for measuring how quickly money in circulation is used to purchase goods and services. It helps economists and investors gauge the health and vitality of an economy. High money velocity is typically associated with healthy, expanding economies. Low money velocity is usually associated with recessions and contractions.

Economists use money velocity to measure the rate at which money is used for goods and services within an economy. While it's not necessarily a critical economic indicator by itself, it can be tracked alongside other key indicators that help determine economic health, such as GDP, unemployment rate, and inflation. GDP and money supply are the two components of the money velocity formula.

Economies with higher money velocity tend to be more developed relative to other economies. Money velocity also fluctuates with business cycles. When the economy is in an expansion phase, consumers and businesses tend to be more willing to spend, leading to faster money velocity. When the economy contracts, consumers and businesses are typically less willing to spend, resulting in lower money velocity.

Since money velocity typically correlates with business cycles, it may also correlate with key indicators. Therefore, money velocity usually rises along with GDP and inflation. Alternatively, it is expected to decline when key economic indicators such as GDP and inflation fall in a contracting economy.

## Example of Money Velocity

Suppose an economy consists of two people, A and B, each having $100 in cash. A buys a car from B for $100. Now B has $200 in cash. Then B buys a house from A for $100, and B hires A to help with new construction on their house, for which B pays A another $100 for their efforts. A now has $200 in cash. Then B sells a car to A for $100, and A and B end up with $100 each in cash. Thus, even though both parties in the economy only had $100 each, they conducted $400 worth of transactions.

In this economy, the velocity of money would be 2, which is calculated by dividing the $400 in transactions by the $200 money supply. This multiplication of the value of goods and services exchanged is achieved through the velocity of money in the economy.

## Money Velocity Formula

While the above provides a simplified example of money velocity, money velocity is used on a larger scale as a measure of transaction activity across an entire nation's population. Generally, this measure can be thought of as the turnover rate of the money supply throughout an economy.

For this application, economists typically use GDP and either M1 or M2 as the money supply. Thus, the money velocity formula is written as GDP divided by the money supply.

$$ \text{Velocity of Money} = \frac{ \text{GDP} }{ \text{Money Supply} } $$

GDP is typically used as the numerator in the money velocity formula, although Gross National Product (GNP) can also be used. GDP represents the total amount of goods and services available for purchase in an economy. In the denominator, economists typically identify velocity for both M1 and M2.

The Federal Reserve defines M1 as the sum of all currency held by the public and transaction deposits at depository institutions. M2 is a broader measure of the money supply that adds savings deposits, time deposits, and retail money market mutual funds. [1] Additionally, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis tracks quarterly velocity of money using both M1 and M2. [2]

## Money Velocity and the Economy

Economists have differing views on whether the velocity of money is a useful indicator of economic health or, more specifically, inflationary pressures. "Monetarists" who adhere to the quantity theory of money believe that, in the absence of expectational changes, the velocity of money should be stable, but changes in money supply may alter expectations, thereby changing both money velocity and inflation.

For example, theoretically, an increase in the money supply should lead to a corresponding rise in prices, as more money chases the same level of goods and services in the economy. A decrease in money supply should have the opposite effect. Critics, on the other hand, argue that in the short term, money velocity varies significantly, and prices are resistant to change, resulting in a weak and indirect connection between money supply and inflation.

Empirically, data shows that money velocity is indeed variable. Furthermore, the relationship between money velocity and inflation is also variable. For instance, from 1959 to the end of 2007, the velocity of M2 money stock averaged approximately 1.9 times, reaching a high of 2.198 times in 1997 and a low of 1.653 times in 1964.[3]

St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank

Since 2007, money velocity has dropped dramatically as the Federal Reserve significantly expanded its balance sheet in response to the global financial crisis and deflationary pressures.

Money velocity appears to have bottomed out at 1.435 in the second quarter of 2017 and gradually increased until the global economic recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic stimulated massive U.S. federal economic stimulus programs. At the end of the second quarter of 2020, M2V was 1.100, the lowest reading of M2 money velocity in history.[3]

## Factors Affecting the Velocity of Money

Several factors influence the velocity of money in an economy. These factors include:

- Money Supply: The velocity of money is inversely proportional to the money supply. When central banks increase the money supply, the speed of economic transactions also increases. This can lead to inflation.
- Consumer Behavior: Velocity is also affected by the behavior of economic actors. When consumers prioritize savings over spending, transaction speed slows down and the velocity of money decreases. When consumers prioritize spending, the velocity of money increases.
- Payment Systems: The velocity of money is also influenced by the characteristics of the monetary system, such as the availability of credit or electronic banking. When there are fewer barriers to transactions, the velocity of money tends to increase; when spending is difficult, it decreases.

## Why is the Velocity of Money Slowing Down?

According to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the velocity of M1 money supply has been steadily declining since the 2008 recession.[4]

Much of this decline is attributed to demographic changes and the impact of the Great Recession. As the Baby Boomer generation approaches retirement age and household wealth has significantly decreased, many consumers have more motivation to save than ever before.

Federal regulations may have also played a role, as the Dodd-Frank Act increased reserve requirements and leverage ratios for banks. Since these institutions are required to hold more assets rather than lend or spend them, there is less money circulating in the economy.

One factor in the slowdown of money velocity isn't mysterious: the COVID-19 pandemic. The velocity of money dropped sharply in 2020, likely due to increased economic uncertainty and the influx of stimulus payments.

## What Does Money Velocity Measure?

Money velocity estimates the circulation of money in an economyâ€”in other words, the average number of times each dollar changes hands within a year. High money velocity indicates a vibrant economy with strong economic activity, while low velocity suggests a general reluctance to spend.

## How to Calculate the Velocity of Money?

The velocity of money is calculated by dividing a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by the total money supply. This calculation can use either M1 money supply (which includes physical currency, checkable deposits, and certain other figures) or M2 supply (which also includes savings deposits and money market funds).

## Why is the Velocity of Money So Low?

According to calculations by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the velocity of money in the United States dropped sharply in the first and second quarters of 2020. While there is no definitive explanation, the decline may be attributed to reduced activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as increased consumer savings due to economic uncertainty.

## Conclusion

The velocity of money represents the heartbeat of the economy. It measures how quickly money changes hands from one transaction to another. During periods of prosperity, the velocity of money tends to be high, indicating busy activity and frequent transactions. During economic recessions, velocity slows down, indicating that consumers are less willing to spend money or engage in transactions.
