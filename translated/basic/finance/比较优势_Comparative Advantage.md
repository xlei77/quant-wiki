## What is Comparative Advantage?

Comparative advantage refers to the ability of an economic entity to produce specific goods or services at a lower opportunity cost than its trading partners. Comparative advantage is used to explain why companies, countries, or individuals can benefit from trade.

In the context of international trade, comparative advantage refers to products that a country can produce more cheaply or easily compared to other countries. However, some contemporary economists argue that focusing solely on comparative advantage may lead to the exploitation and depletion of a country's resources.

The principle of comparative advantage is typically attributed to British political economist David Ricardo and his 1817 book "Principles of Political Economy and Taxation," although it was likely James Mill, Ricardo's mentor, who developed this analysis.[1]

### Key Points

- Comparative advantage refers to an economy's ability to produce specific goods or services at a lower opportunity cost than its trading partners.
- Comparative advantage theory introduces opportunity cost as an analytical factor for making choices between different production options.
- Comparative advantage suggests that countries will trade with each other, exporting goods in which they have a relative advantage.
- Focusing solely on a country's comparative advantage has drawbacks, as it may lead to exploitation of the country's labor force and natural resources.
- Absolute advantage refers to a country's undisputed superiority in producing specific goods.

## Understanding Comparative Advantage

Comparative advantage is one of the most important concepts in economic theory and serves as the fundamental principle behind the argument that all participants can mutually benefit from cooperation and voluntary trade at any time. It is also a foundational principle of international trade theory.

The key to understanding comparative advantage lies in a deep understanding of opportunity cost. In simple terms, opportunity cost refers to the potential benefit someone loses when choosing one option over another.

In the case of comparative advantage, one company's opportunity cost (that is, the potential benefit foregone) is lower than another company's. The company with the lower opportunity cost, and thus the least potential benefit lost, possesses this advantage.

Another way to think about comparative advantage is to view it as the best choice after considering trade-offs. If you are comparing two different options, each with its own trade-offs (some benefits and some drawbacks), the one with the better overall proposition has the comparative advantage.

People learn about their comparative advantages through wages. This drives people to pursue work in areas where they are relatively more skilled. If a skilled mathematician can earn more money as an engineer than as a teacher, then both they and everyone they trade with become better off when they work as an engineer.

Larger gaps in opportunity costs can increase the level of value production through more efficient organization of labor. The greater the diversity of people and their skills, the greater the opportunities for beneficial trade through comparative advantage.

## Example of Comparative Advantage

For example, consider a famous athlete like Michael Jordan. As a renowned basketball and baseball star, Michael Jordan is an exceptional athlete whose physical abilities surpass most others. Michael Jordan could probably paint his house quickly, thanks to his abilities and impressive height.

Let's assume Michael Jordan could paint his house in eight hours. However, in those same eight hours, he could also film a television commercial that would earn him $50,000. In contrast, Jordan's neighbor Joe could paint Jordan's house in 10 hours. During that same time, he could also work at a fast-food restaurant and earn $100.

In this example, Joe has the comparative advantage as a house painter because his opportunity cost is lower, even though Michael Jordan could paint the house faster and better. The best deal is for Michael Jordan to film the television commercial and pay Joe to paint his house. As long as Michael Jordan earns his expected $50,000 and Joe earns more than $100, the deal is a winner. Due to their diverse skill sets, Michael Jordan and Joe would likely find this to be the most mutually beneficial arrangement.

## Comparative Advantage vs. Absolute Advantage

Comparative advantage contrasts with absolute advantage. Absolute advantage refers to the ability to produce more or better goods and services than others. Comparative advantage refers to the ability to produce goods and services at a lower opportunity cost, not necessarily in greater quantity or quality.

To see the difference, consider a lawyer and their secretary. The lawyer is better than the secretary at providing legal services and is also a faster typist and organizer. In this case, the lawyer has absolute advantage in both legal services and secretarial work.

However, they benefit from trade thanks to their comparative advantages and disadvantages. Suppose the lawyer can provide $175 worth of legal services per hour and $25 worth of secretarial services per hour. The secretary can provide $0 worth of legal services and $20 worth of secretarial services per hour. Here, opportunity cost plays a crucial role.

To earn $25 from secretarial work, the lawyer must forfeit $175 in income by not practicing law. Their opportunity cost for secretarial work is high. They are better off providing an hour of legal services and hiring a secretary for typing and organizing. The secretary is better off typing and organizing for the lawyer; their opportunity cost for doing so is low. This is where their comparative advantage lies.

**Important Note:** Comparative advantage is a key insight that trade will occur even when one country has absolute advantage in all products.

## Comparative Advantage vs. Competitive Advantage

Competitive advantage refers to the ability of a company, economy, nation, or individual to deliver greater value to consumers than their competitors. It is similar to, but distinct from, comparative advantage.

To gain a competitive advantage over others within the same field or region, at least one of these three things must be accomplished: the company should be a low-cost provider of its goods or services, it should offer superior goods or services compared to its competitors, or it should focus on a specific segment within the consumer market.

## Comparative Advantage in International Trade

David Ricardo famously demonstrated how England and Portugal could benefit from specialization and trade based on their comparative advantages. In this case, Portugal could produce wine at a low cost, while England could manufacture cloth cheaply. Ricardo predicted that each country would eventually recognize these facts and stop attempting to produce products that cost more to produce.

Indeed, over time, England stopped producing wine, and Portugal stopped manufacturing cloth. Both countries found it beneficial to cease their efforts to produce these goods domestically and instead trade with each other to obtain them.

**Note:** Comparative advantage is closely related to free trade, which is viewed as beneficial, while tariffs are associated with restricted trade and zero-sum games.

A contemporary example: China's comparative advantage versus the United States lies in cheap labor. Chinese workers produce simple consumer goods at a much lower opportunity cost. America's comparative advantage lies in specialized, capital-intensive labor. American workers produce complex goods or investment opportunities at a lower opportunity cost. Specialization and trade along these lines benefit both parties.

The theory of comparative advantage helps explain why protectionism is usually unsuccessful. Proponents of this analytical approach argue that countries engaged in international trade have already worked to find partners with comparative advantages.

If a country withdraws from international trade agreements and imposes tariffs, it may generate local benefits in the form of new jobs and industries. However, this is not a long-term solution to trade issues. Eventually, the country will be at a disadvantage relative to its neighbors who have already been able to produce these goods better at a lower opportunity cost.

**Note:** The classical understanding of comparative advantage does not account for some drawbacks of over-specialization. For example, an agricultural country that focuses on cash crops and relies on world markets for food might find itself vulnerable to global price shocks.

## Criticisms of Comparative Advantage

Why isn't there open trade between all countries in the world? When free trade exists, why do some countries remain poor at the expense of others? Perhaps comparative advantage doesn't work as suggested. There may be many reasons for this, but the most influential is what economists call rent-seeking behavior. Rent-seeking occurs when a group organizes and lobbies the government to protect its interests.

For example, suppose U.S. shoe manufacturers understand and agree with the arguments for free trade, but they also know that their narrow interests will be negatively affected by cheaper foreign shoes. Even though labor would be most productive by shifting from making shoes to making computers, no one in the shoe industry wants to lose their job or see profits decline in the short term.

This desire leads shoe manufacturers to lobby for, for instance, special tax breaks for their products or additional tariffs on foreign shoes (or even outright bans). Appeals to save American jobs and protect a historic American craft abound, even though in the long run, through such protectionist policies, American labor will be relatively less productive and American consumers will be relatively poorer.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Comparative Advantage

In international trade, the principle of comparative advantage is often used to justify globalization, as countries can achieve better material outcomes by only producing goods in which they have a comparative advantage and trading these goods with other nations. Countries like China and South Korea have achieved significant productivity gains by specializing their economies in certain export-oriented industries where they hold comparative advantages.

Following comparative advantage can improve production efficiency because it focuses only on tasks or products that can be completed more cheaply. Products that are more expensive or time-consuming can be purchased from elsewhere. In turn, this will increase the overall profit margin for companies or countries, as costs associated with less efficient production will be eliminated.

On the other hand, excessive specialization can also have negative effects, particularly for developing countries. While free trade allows developed countries to access cheap industrial labor, it also comes with high human costs due to the exploitation of local workers.

By outsourcing manufacturing to countries with less stringent labor laws, companies can benefit from child labor and forced employment practices that would be illegal in their home countries.

Similarly, an agricultural country focusing solely on certain export crops may find itself suffering from soil depletion and natural resource degradation, as well as harm to indigenous peoples. Furthermore, over-specialization presents strategic disadvantages, as the country finds itself dependent on global food prices.[2]

## Who Developed the Law of Comparative Advantage?

The law of comparative advantage is typically attributed to David Ricardo, who described the theory in his 1817 work "Principles of Political Economy and Taxation." However, the concept of comparative advantage may have originated with Ricardo's mentor and editor James Mill, who also wrote about the subject.[3]

## How to Calculate Comparative Advantage?

Comparative advantage is typically measured in terms of opportunity cost, which is the value of alternative goods that could be produced with the same resources. This is then compared with the opportunity cost of producing the same goods by another economic actor. For example, if Factory A can produce 100 pairs of shoes with the same resources needed to produce 500 belts, then the opportunity cost of each pair of shoes is 5 belts. If competitor Factory B can produce three belts with the resources needed to produce one pair of shoes, then Factory A has a comparative advantage in producing belts, while Factory B has a comparative advantage in producing shoes.

## What is an example of comparative advantage?

An interesting example of comparative advantage often arises for senior executives who might consider hiring an assistant to respond to their emails and perform certain secretarial functions. The executive might even be better at performing these duties than their assistant—but their time could be more effectively used doing executive work instead of secretarial work. Similarly, even if the assistant is mediocre at secretarial work, they might be even less suited for executive work. By focusing on their comparative advantages, they will ultimately be more efficient.

## Bottom Line

Comparative advantage is one of the most important concepts in economics. In classical economics, this idea explains why people, nations, and companies can achieve greater collective benefits through trade and exchange than by producing alone. However, contemporary economists also point out that these gains may be one-sided or lead to exploitation of vulnerable groups.
