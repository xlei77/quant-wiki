## What is AAA Credit Rating?

AAA is the highest possible rating assigned to an issuer's bonds by major credit rating agencies. AAA-rated bonds have superior credit quality because their issuers can easily meet financial commitments and carry the lowest risk of default.

Credit rating agencies Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings use the letters AAA to identify bonds with the highest credit quality, while Moody's uses a slightly different notation Aaa to indicate the top credit rating for bonds.

### Key Points

- The highest possible bond rating is AAA, which is only awarded to bonds that demonstrate the highest creditworthiness.
- The AAA rating is used by Fitch and Standard & Poor's, while Moody's uses a similar Aaa notation.
- Bonds with AAA ratings are considered to have the lowest probability of default.
- Issuers of AAA-rated bonds typically find it easier to attract investors, although these bonds offer lower yields than lower-rated bonds due to their high credit rating.

## Understanding AAA Credit Ratings

Credit ratings are assessments or opinions of an enterprise's or government's creditworthiness. As such, they provide alerts about the likelihood that the issuing entity will fulfill its financial obligations, including bill payments. Investors can use these ratings to determine the investment safety of countries and bond issues. These ratings are assigned by credit rating agencies, particularly S&P, Moody's, and Fitch.

AAA and Aaa ratings are considered investment grade. Due to being considered the lowest default risk, these instruments typically offer investors the lowest yields among bonds with similar maturities (lower risk, lower return). The term default refers to when a bond issuer fails to meet its obligations, meaning failure to make semi-annual interest payments on time or repay the principal at maturity.

AAA ratings are awarded to government debt and corporate bonds. The 2008 global credit crisis led many companies to lose their AAA ratings, most notably General Electric (GE). As of August 2023, only Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) still maintain AAA ratings. Apple (AAPL) has split ratings, with Moody's assigning it Aaa while Standard & Poor's rates it AA+ (one notch below AAA).

Even the United States experienced a downgrade by Standard & Poor's to AA+ in 2011, losing its prestigious AAA status due to political disputes preventing debt ceiling increases. Moody's and Fitch maintained their Aaa and AAA ratings for the US respectively. Until August 2023, when Fitch downgraded the US's long-term rating from AAA to AA+, citing potential fiscal deterioration over the next three years and rising government debt concerns.

**Important Note**: Investors should not limit their fixed-income investments to AAA-rated bonds but should consider balancing these investments with bonds offering higher yields, such as high-yield corporate bonds.

## Types of AAA-Rated Bonds

Municipal bonds can be issued as either revenue bonds or general obligation bonds, with these two types relying on different sources of revenue.

Revenue bonds, for example, are paid through fees and other specific revenue sources (such as city swimming pools and sports facilities). General obligation bonds, on the other hand, are secured by the issuer's ability to raise capital through taxation. State bonds rely on state income taxes, while local school districts rely on property taxes.

Issuers can sell secured bonds and unsecured bonds. Each type of bond carries different risk characteristics.

Secured bonds mean that specific assets are pledged as collateral for the bonds, and creditors have the right to claim these assets if the issuer defaults. Secured bonds may be backed by physical assets such as equipment, machinery, or real estate. Secured financing may have a higher credit rating than unsecured bonds issued by the same issuer.

In contrast, unsecured bonds are backed only by the issuer's promise to repay. Therefore, the credit rating of such instruments largely depends on the issuer's revenue sources and business prospects.

## Benefits of AAA Rating

A high credit rating reduces the borrowing costs for issuers (or borrowers). As a result, companies with high ratings have greater ability to borrow large amounts through fixed-income instruments, and the lower borrowing costs enable these companies to access credit more easily, thereby promoting business growth and gaining significant competitive advantages.

For example, a company can use funds from new debt issuance to launch new product lines, open stores in new locations, or acquire competitors. All these initiatives can help the company increase market share and achieve long-term prosperity.

## Why are credit ratings so important?

The level of credit rating obtained by an issuer has a significant impact on borrowing costs in the open market. The higher the credit rating (AAA being the best), the lower the borrowing cost, and vice versa.

As an investor, you need to find a balance between the risk you're willing to take and the expected returns.

## Who Determines the Credit Rating of Debt Issuers?

There are three main credit rating agencies: Standard & Poor's (S&P), Moody's, and Fitch. They assess the creditworthiness of debt issuers and their ability to repay bond interest and principal based on multiple factors, such as the company's cash flow, amount of other outstanding debt, and business prospects.

## What does an AAA Credit Rating Mean?

AAA credit rating is only granted to debt issuers with the highest creditworthiness, enabling investors to measure the level of risk in their fixed-income portfolios. Conservative investors typically sacrifice returns or yields in exchange for holding bonds with the highest credit ratings.

## Summary

Credit ratings are assigned to debt issues and bonds by the three major rating agencies: S&P, Moody's, and Fitch. Their credit ratings have a significant impact on the borrowing costs for issuers. The higher the credit rating, the lower the borrowing cost.

AAA/Aaa rating is the highest rating issued by credit rating agencies and typically implies the lowest borrowing cost or yield. Investors seeking higher returns should focus on bond issuers with lower credit ratings and higher yields.
