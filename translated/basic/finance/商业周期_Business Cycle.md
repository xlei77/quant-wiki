## What is the Business Cycle?

A business cycle refers to a type of fluctuation in a country's overall economic activity—a cycle consists of expansions occurring roughly simultaneously across many economic activities, followed by similarly general contractions. This sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic.

Business cycles are also known as economic cycles.

### Key Points

- Business cycles consist of coordinated cyclical rises and falls in broad indicators of economic activity (output, employment, income, and sales).
- The alternating phases of the business cycle are expansion and contraction.
- Contractions usually lead to recessions, but the entire phase is not always a recession.
- Recessions typically begin at the peak of the business cycle—when expansion ends—and end at the trough of the business cycle, when the next expansion begins.
- The severity of recessions is measured by three D's: depth, diffusion, and duration.

## Understanding Business Cycles

Essentially, business cycles are characterized by alternating phases of expansion and contraction in overall economic activity, along with coordinated movements among economic variables during each phase of the cycle.

Overall economic activity is represented not only by real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) GDP (a measure of total output) but also by aggregate indicators of industrial production, employment, income, and sales, which are key coincident economic indicators used for official determination of U.S. business cycle peak and trough dates.

A common misconception is that the contraction phase equals a recession, and that two consecutive quarters of declining real GDP (an informal rule of thumb) signifies a recession.

It's important to note that recessions occur during contractions, but not necessarily for the entire contraction phase. Furthermore, consecutive declines in real GDP is one of the indicators used by the NBER, but it is not the definition the organization uses to determine recession periods.[1]2

On the other hand, business cycle recovery begins when the vicious cycle of recession reverses into a virtuous cycle, where rising output triggers employment growth, income increases, and sales growth, which in turn drive further increases in output.

Only when recovery becomes self-sustaining can it persist and lead to sustained economic expansion, with this domino effect ensuring the recovery's diffusion throughout the economy.

**Important Note:** Of course, the stock market is not the economy. Therefore, business cycles should not be confused with market cycles, which are measured using broad stock price indices.

## Measuring and Determining Business Cycles

The severity of a recession is measured by three D's: depth, diffusion, and duration. The depth of a recession is determined by the decline from peak to trough in broad indicators of output, employment, income, and sales.

Its diffusion is measured by how widely it spreads across economic activities, industries, and geographic regions. Its duration is determined by the time interval between peak and trough.

An expansion begins at the trough (or bottom) of a business cycle and continues until the next peak, while a recession begins at that peak and continues until the next trough.

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) determines the business cycle chronology—the dates of the beginnings and ends of U.S. recessions and expansions.

Thus, its Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as "a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales."[3]

**Note:** During the Great Depression, there were multiple recessions, one of which lasted 44 months.[4]

The Dating Committee typically determines the start and end dates of recessions long after the fact. For example, after the 2007-09 recession ended, it "waited until the revisions in the National Income and Product Accounts were released on July 30 and August 27, 2010" and announced the June 2009 recession end date on September 20, 2010.[5]

On average, U.S. expansions last longer than U.S. contractions. Between 1945 and 2019, the average expansion lasted about 65 months. The average recession lasted about 11 months.[6]

From the 1850s through World War II, the average expansion lasted about 26 months, and the average recession lasted about 21 months. The longest expansion was from 2009 to 2020, lasting 128 months.[6]

## Stock Prices and Business Cycles

The largest stock price declines often occur around periods of business cycle downturns (e.g., contractions and recessions), though this is not always the case. For example, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 fell dramatically during the Great Recession. The Dow fell 51.1%, while the S&P 500 fell 56.8% between October 9, 2007, and March 9, 2009.[7]

There are many reasons for this, but it primarily occurs because businesses take defensive measures during contractions and investor confidence declines. Many events occur before people in the economy realize they are in a contraction, but the stock market tracks what is happening in the economy.

Therefore, if speculation or rumors about recession, massive layoffs, rising unemployment, declining output, or other signs appear, businesses and investors begin to worry about recession and take action accordingly. Businesses adopt defensive strategies, reduce their workforce, and budget for an environment of declining revenues.

Investors rush toward "known" capital-preserving investments, demand for expansionary investments falls, and stock prices decline.

It's important to remember that while stock prices tend to fall during economic contractions, it's not the phase itself that causes stock prices to fall—it's the fear of recession that causes them to fall.

## What are the phases of the business cycle?

Generally speaking, the business cycle consists of four distinct phases: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough.

## What Does the Business Cycle Describe?

The business cycle describes the fluctuations in the economy over a period of time, typically from the start of one recession to the start of the next recession. This includes periods of economic growth.

## Can Business Cycles Be Predicted?

Generally speaking, business cycles are unpredictable. Economies are complex machines that operate in various ways and are intertwined in multiple ways. The ability to predict how they will move is extremely difficult. There may be signs of economic changes, such as changes in inflation and production, but predicting fundamental shifts in business cycles is very difficult, if not impossible.

## Bottom Line

Business cycles are the time it takes for the economy to go through all four phases of the cycle: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. Expansion is a period of increasing business profits and rising economic output, and it's the phase where the U.S. economy spends most of its time. Contraction is a period of declining profits and falling output, and it's the phase that takes the least amount of time.
