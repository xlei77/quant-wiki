## What is a Bear Market?

A bear market refers to a prolonged period of declining prices in financial markets, typically characterized by a drop of 20% or more. Bear markets are usually accompanied by widespread investor pessimism, large-scale liquidation of securities and other assets, and economic weakness.

Bear markets are typically associated with declines in overall markets or indices (such as the S&P 500), but individual securities or commodities can also be considered in a bear market if they fall 20% or more over a sustained period (usually two months or longer). Bear markets may also coincide with broader economic downturns, such as recessions. Bear markets are considered the opposite of rising bull markets.

### Key Points

- A bear market occurs when market prices fall by more than 20%, typically accompanied by negative investor sentiment and weak economic conditions.
- Bear markets can be cyclical or secular. The former lasts weeks or months, while the latter can persist for years or even decades.
- Short selling, put options, and inverse ETFs are some ways investors can profit from falling prices during bear markets.

## Understanding Bear Markets

Stock prices typically reflect investors' expectations of company performance. If a company's profits fall below expectations, or growth is lower than analyst predictions, investors may react by selling the company's stock, leading to an overall price decline. The combination of herd mentality and fear can trigger a cascade of actions aimed at minimizing losses, which in turn can lead to prolonged asset price depression.

One definition of a bear market is when stocks fall at least 20% on average from their peak, entering bear market territory. However, 20% is an arbitrary number, just as a 10% decline is an arbitrary benchmark for a correction. Another definition of a bear market is when investors become more risk-averse than risk-seeking. This type of bear market can last for months or years, as investors shy away from speculation in favor of boring but safe investments.

The causes of bear markets vary, but generally, weak or slowing economies, bursting market bubbles, pandemics, wars, geopolitical crises, and dramatic paradigm shifts in the economy (such as the shift to online economies) are all potential factors that can lead to bear markets. Signs of a weak or slowing economy typically include:

- Low employment rates
- Low disposable income
- Low productivity
- Declining corporate profits

Government intervention in the economy can also trigger bear markets. For example, changes in tax rates or federal funds rates may lead to bear markets. Similarly, declining investor confidence can signal the beginning of a bear market. When investors believe something is about to happen, they take action—selling stocks to avoid losses in an impending bear market.

Bear markets can last for years or just weeks. Long-term bear markets can last 10 to 20 years and are characterized by sustained below-average returns. During long-term bear markets, there may be rallies where stocks or indices bounce back for a period, but gains don't hold, and prices fall back to lower levels. On the other hand, cyclical bear markets can last anywhere from weeks to months.

On December 24, 2018, major U.S. market indices approached bear market territory, falling just short of 20%.[1] More recently, major indices including the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell sharply into bear market territory between March 11 and March 12, 2020.[2] Prior to this, the last prolonged bear market in the U.S. occurred during the financial crisis of 2007-2009, lasting approximately 17 months. During this period, the S&P 500 lost 50% of its value.[3]

In February 2020, global stock markets suddenly entered a bear market following the global coronavirus pandemic, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 38% from its historical high of 29,568.77 on February 12 to a low of 18,213.65 on March 23, taking just over a month.[4] However, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 reached new highs in August 2020.[5]

## Bear Market Phases

A bear market typically has four distinct phases.

The first phase is characterized by high prices and high investor sentiment. Near the end of this phase, investors begin to exit the market and take profits.

In the second phase, stock prices begin to fall sharply, trading activity and corporate profits start to decline, and previously positive economic indicators fall below average. As sentiment begins to decline, some investors start to panic. This is known as capitulation.

The third phase shows speculators entering the market, thus raising some prices and trading volumes.

In the fourth and final phase, stock prices continue to fall but at a slower pace. As low prices and positive news begin to attract investors again, the bear market starts to lead into a bull market.

**"Bear" and "Bull":** The bear market phenomenon is thought to be named after the way a bear attacks its prey—by swiping its paws downward. This is why a market with falling stock prices is called a bear market. Similarly, a bull market may be named after the way a bull attacks by thrusting its horns up into the air.

## Bear Markets and Corrections

Bear markets should not be confused with corrections, which are short-term trends lasting less than two months.

While corrections provide value investors with an opportunity to find entry points into the stock market, bear markets rarely offer suitable entry points. This obstacle exists because it's almost impossible to identify the bottom of a bear market. Unless investors are short sellers or use other strategies to profit in falling markets, trying to recover losses can be an uphill battle.

Between 1900 and 2018, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) experienced approximately 33 bear markets, averaging one every three years.[6] One of the most notable bear markets in recent history coincided with the global financial crisis between October 2007 and March 2009. During this period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 54%.[3] The global COVID-19 pandemic led to the most recent bear market in 2020 for both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The NASDAQ Composite entered a bear market most recently in March 2022 due to concerns about the Ukraine war, economic sanctions against Russia, and high inflation.[7]

## Short Selling in a Bear Market

Investors can profit during bear markets through short selling. This technique involves selling borrowed stocks and buying them back at a lower price. It is an extremely high-risk trade that can result in substantial losses if unsuccessful. Short sellers must borrow shares from their broker before placing a short sell order. The short seller's profit or loss is the difference between the selling price and the buyback price, known as "covering."

For example, an investor shorts 100 shares of stock at $94. The price drops, and the stock is covered at $84. The investor earns a profit of $10 x 100 = $1,000. If the stock unexpectedly rises, the investor will be forced to buy back the shares at a premium, resulting in significant losses.

Short selling is a risky trading strategy that can lead to high losses. It is not suitable for inexperienced investors.

## Put Options and Inverse ETFs in Bear Markets

Put options give the owner the freedom, but not the obligation, to sell stock at a specific price on or before a specific date. Put options can be used to speculate on stock price declines and hedge against price drops to protect long-only portfolios. Investors must have options privileges in their accounts to conduct such trades. Outside of bear markets, buying put options is generally safer than short selling.

Inverse ETFs are designed to change in value in the opposite direction of the index they track. For example, if the S&P 500 falls 1%, an inverse ETF of the S&P 500 will rise 1%. There are many leveraged inverse ETFs that amplify the returns of the indices they track by two and three times. Like options, inverse ETFs can be used for speculation or portfolio protection.

## Real Examples of Bear Markets

The expanding mortgage default crisis swept through the stock market in October 2007. At that time, the S&P 500 index reached a high of 1,565.15 on October 9, 2007.[8] By March 5, 2009, it had plummeted to 682.55 as the impact and consequences of mortgage defaults on the overall economy became clear.[9] On December 24, 2018, major U.S. market indices again approached bear market territory, falling just short of 20%.[1]

More recently, the Dow Jones Industrial Average entered a bear market on March 11, 2020, followed by the S&P 500 on March 12, 2020.[10] This came after the longest bull market on record, which had begun in March 2009. The stock market declined due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought widespread lockdowns and concerns about weakening consumer demand. During this period, the Dow Jones dropped dramatically from its historical high of nearly 30,000 points to below 19,000 points within weeks. The S&P 500 fell 34% from February 19 to March 23.[11][12]

Other examples include the aftermath of the Internet bubble burst in March 2000, which erased approximately 49% of the S&P 500's value and lasted until October 2002;[13] and the Great Depression, which began with the stock market crash of October 28-29, 1929.[14]

## What are the main differences between bear markets and bull markets?

The main difference between bear markets and bull markets is that a bear market refers to a significant decline in financial markets, while a bull market refers to a significant rise. Markets perform well during bull markets and poorly during bear markets.

## Is Buying During a Bear Market a Good Thing?

Long-term investors can find many valuable stocks at lower prices during a bear market, and if you have the ability to wait for your investments to rebound, a bear market is a good time to buy. Traders hoping for short-term profits may need to use other strategies during bear markets, such as short selling.

## Should I Sell My Stocks During a Bear Market?

For most investors, a buy-and-hold strategy is the best way to make money through investing, rather than rushing to buy or sell investments every time the market changes. If you have a balanced, diversified portfolio that includes assets such as government bonds, defensive stocks, and cash alongside stocks, there's no need to sell during a bear market. In fact, if you sell stocks during a bear market because you're afraid they'll fall further, you might miss out on substantial profits when the market eventually rebounds.

## Bottom Line

A bear market is a downward trend in financial markets, indicating economic weakness and loss of investor confidence. Generally, a market is considered to be in a bear market when prices fall by more than 20%. Bear markets can last from a few weeks to several years.

Buy-and-hold investors can often take advantage of lower prices during bear markets to add valuable stocks to their portfolios. However, day traders and other short-term investors may need to use strategies such as short selling, put options, and inverse ETFs to profit during bear markets.
