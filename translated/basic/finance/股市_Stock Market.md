The stock market is not a physical place you can visit, but rather refers to the trading of stocks (some physical, but mostly online) that represent partial ownership in companies. It's not only a place where businesses raise capital, but also serves as an indicator used to measure the health of the economy.

### Key Points

- The stock market refers to the collective trading network involving stocks and their derivatives.
- The stock market is the original form of crowdfunding and a core component of the modern economy, as companies can raise substantial capital here for startups, expansion, or debt repayment.
- Companies listed on stock exchanges must be public, meaning their shares are not only open to a select few but can be traded on exchanges and elsewhere. Listed companies are subject to numerous reporting and transparency regulations.
- Stocks are sold to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, as well as to people of more modest means who hope to earn income from profit sharing, sell shares later at higher prices, or simply have a voice in company operations.
- The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and state regulators oversee the U.S. stock market.[1]2

Stock prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, company performance, economic conditions, and other factors that might seem irrational (such as investor "sentiment"), but all these factors must be considered when buying or selling stocks.

People buy stocks for many reasons. Some hold stocks seeking dividend income. Others might believe a stock will rise, so they buy quickly, trying to buy low and sell high. Still others might be interested in participating in how a specific company operates. This is because you can vote at shareholder meetings based on the number of shares you own.

The terms "stock market" and "stock exchange" are often used interchangeably, but they're not the same. Stock market traders buy and sell shares on one or more stock exchanges, while a stock exchange is just one part of the overall stock market. Major U.S. exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.

## How Does the Stock Market Work?

The stock market is a vast and complex network of trading activities where company shares are bought and sold, protected by laws against fraud and other unfair trading practices. It plays a crucial role in modern economies by enabling the flow of capital between investors and companies.

Sometimes, the best way to understand how something works is to look at its components. So, let's review the main elements of the stock market, from companies selling shares to the stocks themselves, to exchanges, and to indices that give us snapshots of stock market health:

Not all companies can offer stocks to the public. Only publicly traded companies that have issued shares in an Initial Public Offering (IPO) can have their stocks traded on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. Throughout the time from when a company starts planning its IPO until its shares are sold to the public, it must comply with strict regulations and financial disclosure laws.

The primary market may involve raising money and giving portions of businesses to friends, family, and others in direct deals, making it the oldest way of dividing up company shares. Since the primary market is where companies sell their securities directly, today it includes IPOs, follow-on public offerings, private placements, debt issuances, and other times when corporations sell parts of themselves to raise money.

From there, stocks trade on secondary markets through exchanges or "over-the-counter." Today, more than 58,000 companies trade publicly worldwide.[3]

When you buy stock or shares, you're getting a piece of that company. How much of the company you own depends on how many shares the company has issued and how many shares you own. In a small private company, one share might represent a large portion of the company. Large public companies typically have millions or even billions of shares. Apple (AAPL), for example, has billions of shares outstanding, so one share is just a tiny fraction of the company.

Owning stock gives you the right to share in the company's profits (usually paid as dividends) and sometimes to vote on company matters.

Once a company goes public, its shares can trade freely in the stock market. This means investors can buy and sell shares between themselves. This is the secondary market for stocks, and most trading happens through stock exchanges. This part of the stock market dates back at least to Amsterdam in 1602 and has since evolved into some of the world's most sophisticated institutions.

Stock exchanges are organized and regulated "places" (though much trading is virtual today) where stocks and other types of securities are bought and sold. They play a vital role in the financial system by providing companies with a platform to raise money by selling their shares and bonds to the public.

The New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ are prime examples, serving as central locations for buying and selling stocks. Major exchanges exist worldwide, such as the London Stock Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Shanghai Stock Exchange. Each exchange has its own internal rules, and investors follow different national and local laws. These are designed to ensure fair trading practices and give investors confidence in trading there. They also provide transparency in the trading process, offering real-time information about security prices, which is why it's easy to find current stock prices on almost any financial news website.

However, exchanges wouldn't be worth their name if they couldn't provide liquidity â€“ the ability to buy and sell stocks relatively easily. This means you can quickly purchase shares during trading hours, or equally quickly sell them to raise cash.

Many exchanges also cross-list company shares, offering securities that primarily list on other exchanges. This way, companies can reach more investors when raising money, and those who trade with certain exchanges have more options.

**Note:** While it's called the stock market, other securities, such as Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), also trade there.

Stocks and other securities also trade "over-the-counter" (OTC). These OTC markets are where you buy and sell stocks directly with another investor, usually without the same level of regulation or public oversight as stock exchanges. OTC trading involves networks of brokers and dealers who negotiate directly through computer networks and phones.

This type of trading is typically used for smaller, less liquid companies that might not meet the strict listing requirements of stock exchanges. This can make it harder for investors to get reliable information about the companies they're investing in.

Beyond common stocks, many other assets trade through exchanges and OTC markets. These all count as part of the "stock market":

- American Depositary Receipts: These represent shares in foreign companies and trade on U.S. exchanges. They allow U.S. investors to invest in foreign companies without dealing with foreign exchanges or converting currencies.
- Derivatives: This is a broad category including options and futures whose value comes from the value of underlying assets like stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indices. So in derivatives trading, you're not buying or selling the actual asset (like stocks) directly. Instead, you're trading something whose value is affected by changes in the price of the underlying asset.
- Funds: These include mutual funds (which pool money from many investors to buy baskets of stocks, bonds, and other securities) and exchange-traded funds (which trade on exchanges like individual stocks and "track" or try to mirror the performance of an industry, index, or stock theme).
- Preferred Stock: These shares typically offer fixed dividends and, as the name suggests, have priority over common stock in terms of profit sharing or remaining assets after bankruptcy.
- Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Worth mentioning to show you the breadth of the stock market. REITs are companies that own, manage, or finance real estate. Investors can buy shares in them, and they're legally required to offer 90% of their profits as dividends annually.[4]

More loosely, while separate markets, people often think of the following as part of the "stock market":

- Bonds: These represent debt, and governments and corporations issue bonds to raise money. Investors who buy bonds are essentially lending money to the issuer in exchange for interest payments and return of face value when the bond matures.
- Commodities: There are 50 major commodity markets globally where you can buy raw materials like oil, steel, wheat, and coal directly or futures contracts based on where their prices might go.

Stock market participants include institutional investors like pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds that manage large amounts of money and often have significant market impact because they trade in large volumes. Retail investors buy and sell securities for their personal accounts (rather than for organizations). They can range from beginners to experienced traders, and most use online platforms today. Another key group is accredited investors, who are high-net-worth individuals with money and investment experience, so the SEC allows them access to more complex investments like venture capital and private equity.

Generally speaking, investors look at markets with a long-term perspective. They put money into stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and other securities expecting them to grow in value over time; these aren't the quick trades you see in movies where people jump in and out quickly. These investors typically care more about the fundamental strength of the companies or assets they're investing in, like their financial performance, market position, and growth potential. They decide to invest after research and analysis or after getting advice from financial advisors, trying to build wealth steadily through a portfolio that grows over time.

As for traders, they take a shorter-term approach to the stock market. They aim to profit from market volatility by trading stocks, options, futures, and other financial instruments over shorter time frames (from seconds and minutes to days and months). Traders typically rely on technical analysis, which involves studying market trends, charts, and other statistical indicators to predict future price movements. While trading can offer the potential for quick profits, it also comes with higher risks than long-term investing. Buying and selling securities quickly requires a keen understanding of markets and needs a more active, hands-on trading strategy.

Brokers in the stock market play the same role as in insurance and other fields, acting as intermediaries between investors and securities markets. They're licensed organizations that buy and sell stocks and other securities for individual and institutional clients. Brokerage firms can be small boutiques or multinational corporations offering investment advice, research, and wealth management services while executing trades for clients. Full-service brokers provide detailed financial advice, portfolio management, and personalized service, making them more suitable for investors who prefer a comprehensive approach to managing their investments. On the cost side, discount brokers offer a more hands-off experience, typically favored by investors who make their own trading decisions.

Online brokerages have become increasingly popular, offering user-friendly platforms that allow investors to trade securities electronically at lower costs and with more convenience. These platforms typically come with educational resources, analytical tools, and real-time market data. Robo-advisors (automated financial planning services offered at very low costs) are also growing in popularity.

Regardless of the type of broker, they're regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

An important aspect of the stock market (determining what's traded and how) is the regulations and regulatory bodies involved. In the U.S., the latter is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an independent federal agency established in 1934 following the market crash of 1929 and the travails of the Great Depression. The SEC's mission is to "protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation."[5]

The SEC enforces laws against market manipulation, insider trading, and other forms of fraud while verifying that public companies disclose any material financial information investors should know when trusting companies and buying their stock. The SEC also oversees securities exchanges, broker-dealers, investment advisors, mutual funds, and utility holding companies.

Additionally, exchanges have their own requirements, such as timely (usually quarterly) updates of company financial reports and immediate reporting of relevant company developments to ensure everyone who wants to trade has the same information.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) oversees brokerage firms and their registered securities representatives and is more focused on protecting retail investors than the SEC. Similar institutions exist worldwide, which is crucial because stock markets are global, and disasters in one corner of the world quickly spread to another â€“ this isn't just something happening in a few buildings on Wall Street.

While regulations vary greatly between countries â€“ they serve different populations and cultural expectations â€“ general rules are enforced to ensure fair practices, protect investors, and boost confidence in the broader stock market.

Textbook descriptions of stock prices often start with investors and traders gathering together, and for a stock trade to happen, buyers and sellers must agree on a number. But most investors find prices listed in online brokerage accounts or online charts showing stock prices changing over time rather than coming from hard negotiations. That said, you do have to agree to buy stock, and every investor or trader who makes this decision collectively shapes the demand for shares, which combines with the supply available in the market to produce the prices we see on our screens.

Factors affecting these prices mainly fall into two types: fundamentals and technicals. Fundamental factors are rooted in company earnings, operating profitability, and the goods or services it provides. Meanwhile, technical factors relate to market sentiment and statistical analysis of historical market activity and stock price trends.

High share prices might indicate company success â€“ or at least buyers' feeling they're doing well â€“ but can also come from stock splits, dividends, and stock buybacks. When stock prices fall, this doesn't mean money is lost from the entire market. Instead, it indicates a decline in the market value of particular shares. For example, if a company reports profits higher than expected, its stock price might rise as more investors want to buy shares, hoping for future growth. Similarly, economic events like interest rate changes or geopolitical issues can affect investor confidence and stock prices.

Most Americans first learn about the stock market through indices because reporting on whether the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or S&P 500 is up or down has long been a staple of news programs' quick delivery of Wall Street news. Indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average include 30 large public companies to paint a picture of the broader stock market. Indices can be used to take very broad market photos, like the S&P 500, which represents America's 500 largest public companies. There are currently 11 sectors used for specific groups like technology, healthcare, or consumer discretionary companies.

Indices are important because they're used as benchmarks for stocks and portfolios. For example, if you invest in tech stocks, you'll want to see how your shares perform compared to tech indices. Then you'll have a better way to evaluate your returns.

## What Does the Stock Market Do?

The stock market serves several distinct roles worth emphasizing:

Corporate Governance: Listed companies follow strict reporting regulations, making them more transparent and accountable. This information enables investors to make informed decisions and helps maintain investor confidence in the market. For ordinary Americans, this is also an opportunity to understand major U.S. companies, as without these transparency requirements, they might close off much of our understanding of them.

Economic Indicator: Stock market performance is typically considered a measure of economic health. Rising stock prices are associated with corporate profitability and economic growth, while falling prices signal potential future problems.

Investment Opportunities: The stock market provides opportunities to invest in companies and grow portfolios over time. Historically, the stock market has provided returns that exceed inflation, making it an important tool for retirement planning, wealth accumulation, and financial security.[6]

Liquidity: The stock market enables investors to quickly buy and sell company shares and other securities when needed.

Fundraising: Most importantly, the stock market provides a platform where companies can raise funds by issuing stocks. This capital is crucial for business expansion, research and development, and other corporate initiatives. By selling shares to the public, companies can access these funds without taking on debt.

Resource Allocation: Through reflecting the collective judgments made by traders and investors through different company prices, the stock market is said to help efficiently allocate capital to companies more likely to succeed and away from those less likely to succeed.

## Why Is the Stock Market So Important?

Now that we understand the different parts of the stock marketâ€”who, what, where, and how it worksâ€”we can better understand why it holds such significance in today's economy.

When the earliest stock markets were formed, the global economy was vastly different from what it is today. Trade and commerce in those eras were primarily driven by physical goods, with industries like agriculture, textiles, and early manufacturing dominating the economic landscape. Stock markets were emerging institutions that mainly helped fund expeditions and trading venturesâ€”in other words, financing colonial enterprises that sought goods and people from South Asia, the Americas, and Africa. These exchanges were already global investment operations.[7] However, they played a relatively minor role in daily economic life.

Fast forward to today, and the stock market is considered the heart of the global economy, emphasized by the increasing dominance of financialization and financial markets and institutions. This isn't just because over a million Americans work in the financial industry.[8] The modern economy is characterized by a complex network of financial transactions and instruments, where the stock market is not only a barometer of economic health but is seen as key to both distributing and creating wealth.

Financialization also reflects broader socioeconomic changes. Today's stock market is not just a platform for raising capital but is intimately connected to the retirement and investment strategies of millions of Americans. This is why during periods of dangerâ€”2007-2008 and the pandemic being two major examplesâ€”the U.S. government and Federal Reserve felt more obligated than ever to intervene. This wasn't just to protect the wealth of a few but because the savings of a broad swath of Americans were at risk. Not long ago, Americans hearing stock market news might have been focused on indirect effects on their jobsâ€”checking how their company was doing, for instanceâ€”but now they're more often focused on direct effects on their own portfolios, including 401(k) plans.

Of course, many people are paying off college loans, mortgages, and other debts, or are too financially vulnerable to own portfolios of stocks or other assets. Nevertheless, they too feel the stock market's impact. First, markets drive funding for technological advances, like the smartphones in our pockets or the medicines we take, which require billions in R&D costs. This access to capital is crucial for companies venturing into areas like artificial intelligence or new medical devices, where costs are many multiples of what companies could otherwise borrow.

Stock market movements also affect the broader economy and, by extension, employment. Its performance influences company decisions, affecting job creation (and the reverse effect where layoffs can boost stock prices), expansion, and overall economic growth. A healthy stock market typically correlates with a stronger economy. But it can also mean more capital concentrated in the hands of fewer wealthy people, driving up property values in what were once middle-class neighborhoods in nearly every major American city.

The stock market also indirectly affects public services and infrastructure. Pension funds, which are a major component of spending for government employees at local, state, and federal levels, are heavily invested in the stock market. The returns on these investments affect the financial health of pension funds, which in turn affects retirement security for millionsâ€”not counting many more who don't have pensions and are directly invested in the market through 401(k) plans, mutual funds, and individual retirement accounts.

## What are the differences between bond markets and stock markets?

According to the latest available data, the global bond market is larger than the stock market, with approximately $130 trillion in outstanding bonds compared to about $101 trillion in total stock market capitalization.[8] Bond markets and stock markets serve different purposes and offer different risk-return characteristics to investors. In the bond market, investors buy and sell debt securities, typically issued by governments (local, state, and federal) or corporations. When you invest in bonds, you are essentially lending money in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value at maturity.

The stock market involves buying and selling shares of publicly traded companies and derivatives (instruments whose value is related to specific stocks in some way). Investing in stocks means purchasing partial ownership in a company. Stocks offer higher potential returns than bonds because investors can receive dividends when companies are profitable and gains when stock prices rise. They also carry higher risk because stock prices can be more volatile.

## What is an Alternative Trading System?

An Alternative Trading System is a platform for matching large buy and sell trades that operates outside of exchange regulation. Dark pools and many cryptocurrency exchanges are private exchanges or forums for securities and currency trading that operate within private groups.

## Who Helps Investors Trade in the Stock Market?

Stock brokers act as intermediaries between stock exchanges and investors, buying and selling stocks. Portfolio managers are professionals who invest portfolios or collections of securities for their clients. Investment bankers represent companies in various ways, such as helping private companies that wish to go public through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) or planning mergers and acquisitions.

## Bottom Line

The stock market is a place where company stocks and other financial instruments are bought and sold. It is a network for all stock trading where investors and traders can buy and sell shares. These transactions determine stock prices, reflecting companies' perceived value and market conditions. The stock market is also a place where companies can raise capital and investors can build wealth. Therefore, it plays a crucial role in the global economy. Even if you don't trade directly in the stock market, it affects the products you buy, the types of jobs available, and the retirement life you may plan for.
