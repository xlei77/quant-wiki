## What is the Federal Funds Rate?

The "Federal Funds Rate" refers to the target interest rate range set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This target is the rate at which commercial banks lend excess reserves to each other overnight. The FOMC, which is the policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System, meets eight times per year to set the target federal funds rate as part of its monetary policy aimed at promoting economic growth.

### Key Points

- The federal funds rate is a target interest rate range set by the Federal Open Market Committee.
- This is the rate at which commercial banks lend excess reserves to each other overnight.
- The FOMC sets the target federal funds rate eight times per year based on current economic conditions.
- The federal funds rate affects short-term interest rates for consumer loans and credit cards.
- Investors closely monitor the federal funds rate because it impacts the stock market.

## Understanding the Federal Funds Rate

The federal funds rate is the interest rate at which banks lend their excess cash to other institutions from their reserve balances, with these loans being made on an overnight basis.

By law, banks must maintain reserves equal to a certain percentage of their deposits in accounts at Federal Reserve banks. The amount banks must keep in their Fed accounts is called the reserve requirement, based on a certain percentage of the bank's total deposits.

Financial institutions need to maintain interest-bearing accounts at Federal Reserve banks to ensure they have sufficient funds to meet depositor withdrawals and other obligations. Reserves exceeding the required level can be lent to other banks that may be short on reserves.

**Note:** In March 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirements to 0%, effectively eliminating this requirement. The Fed indicated this move would release liquidity into the banking system and had no plans to increase the requirement in the near term.

Banks are judged on whether they meet reserve requirements based on the average of their end-of-day account balances over a two-week reserve maintenance period. If a bank anticipates its end-of-day balance will exceed required levels, it can lend the excess to institutions expecting shortfalls. The rate at which lending banks can charge is the federal funds rate.

The FOMC makes rate adjustment decisions based on key economic indicators that may signal inflation, recession, or other issues affecting sustainable economic growth. These indicators can include core inflation rates and durable goods orders reports.

The federal funds rate target has fluctuated significantly with changing economic conditions. In the early 1980s, it reached as high as 20% in response to inflation. With the Great Recession, rates were dramatically lowered to historic lows of 0% to 0.25% to stimulate economic growth.

As of March 2020, the target rate remained between 0% and 0.25%. By 2022, to combat inflation, the Fed began gradually raising rates, a process that continued into 2023.

The FOMC last raised its federal funds rate target to a range of 5.25% to 5.5% in July 2023, maintaining this range in subsequent meetings and confirming it at its final meeting in June 2024, aligning with its inflation target and full employment objectives. Despite economic expansion and sustained low unemployment, the FOMC remained cautious about persistently high inflation.

## Special Considerations

The FOMC cannot force banks to charge an exact federal funds rate. Instead, the target rate set by the FOMC serves only as a guiding framework. The actual rate charged by lending banks is determined through negotiations between two banks. The weighted average of rates across all such transactions is known as the effective federal funds rate.

Although the FOMC cannot enforce a specific federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve can adjust the money supply to move rates toward the target rate. By increasing the amount of money in the system, rates can be pushed lower; conversely, by reducing the money supply, rates may be pushed higher.

In addition to the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve also sets the discount rate, which is the rate the Fed charges banks that borrow directly from it. This rate is typically higher than the target federal funds rate, partly to encourage banks to borrow from other banks at the lower federal funds rate.

## Federal Funds Rate Impact

The federal funds rate is one of the most important interest rates in the U.S. economy. This is because it influences monetary and financial conditions, which in turn affect key aspects of the broader economy, such as employment, growth, and inflation.

This rate indirectly affects short-term interest rates, from mortgages and car loans to credit cards, as lenders typically set their rates based on the prime lending rate. The prime rate is the rate banks charge their most creditworthy customers, and these rates are also influenced by the federal funds rate.

Investors pay close attention to the federal funds rate. Stock markets typically react strongly to changes in the target rate.

For example, a small decrease in rates can trigger a significant market rally as companies' borrowing costs decrease. Many stock analysts pay particular attention to statements from FOMC members in an attempt to understand future directions of the target rate.

## How Does the Federal Funds Rate Work?

The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other when lending or borrowing excess reserves overnight. Banks are legally required to maintain minimum reserve levels, calculated as a proportion of their deposits. These reserve requirements are held at Federal Reserve banks. When banks have excess reserves, they can lend these funds overnight to other banks that have reserve shortfalls.

## How is the Federal Funds Rate Determined?

The Federal Open Market Committee typically meets eight times per year to determine the federal funds rate. These rates are influenced by economic indicators such as core inflation rates and durable goods orders reports, which provide signals about the nation's economic health.

## What is the difference between the Federal Funds Rate and conventional interest rates?

The Federal Funds Rate and interest rates are among the most important financial indicators in the United States. Their main difference is that the Federal Funds Rate sets the range of interest rates at which banks lend to each other overnight. Since this affects borrowing costs and financial conditions, stock markets are typically very sensitive to changes in these rates. The Federal Funds Rate also indirectly influences short-term interest rates. In contrast, interest rates are set by the Federal Reserve to determine the cost of bank lending.

## Summary

The federal funds rate is used by the Federal Reserve to control monetary policy and is closely monitored by investors to assess potential future market directions. This rate is one of the most important financial indicators in the United States.
