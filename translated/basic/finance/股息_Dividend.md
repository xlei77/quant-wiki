## What is a Dividend?

A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings to its shareholders, as determined by the company's board of directors. Dividends are typically distributed quarterly and can be paid in cash or reinvested in additional shares of stock.

Dividend yield is the dividend per share expressed as a percentage of the company's stock price (dividend/price), for example, 2.5%. [1]

Common stockholders of the dividend-paying company are eligible for distribution as long as they own the stock before the ex-dividend date.

### Key Points

- Dividends are the distribution of company profits to eligible shareholders.
- Dividend payments and amounts are determined by the company's board of directors.
- Dividend yield is the dividend per share expressed as a percentage of the company's stock price.
- Many companies do not pay dividends, instead retaining earnings for reinvestment in the company.

## Understanding Dividends

Dividends must be approved by shareholder voting rights.[2] While cash dividends are common, dividends can also be issued in the form of stocks. Various mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also pay dividends.

Dividends are returns on shareholders' investment in company equity, typically sourced from the company's net profit. For investors, dividends represent an asset, but for companies, they are viewed as a liability. While profits can be retained within the company as retained earnings for ongoing and future business activities, the remaining portion can be distributed to shareholders as dividends.

Companies can still pay dividends even if they haven't earned sufficient profits to maintain their established distribution record.

The board of directors can choose to issue dividends at different payment rates over different time frames. Dividends can be paid according to scheduled frequencies, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually. For example, Walmart (WMT) and Unilever (UL) make regular quarterly dividend payments.[3]4

Companies can also issue non-recurring special dividends, either standalone or as supplements to scheduled dividends. United Bancorp Inc. announced a special dividend of 15 cents per share on February 23, 2023.[5]

## Dividend-Paying Companies

Large, mature companies with predictable profits are typically the best dividend payers, with the following industry sectors maintaining regular dividend payment records:

- Basic Materials
- Oil and Gas
- Banking and Finance
- Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals
- Utilities

Companies structured as Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are required to make specific distributions to shareholders.[6] 7 Funds can also pay regular dividends according to their investment objectives.

Startup companies, such as those in technology or biotechnology sectors, may not offer regular dividends as they might be in early stages of development and retain earnings for research and development, business expansion, and operational activities.

## Important Dividend Dates

Dividend payments follow a series of chronologically ordered events, with the relevant dates being crucial for determining which shareholders are eligible to receive dividend payments.

- Announcement Date: Dividends are announced by company management on the announcement date (or declaration date) and must be approved by shareholders before payment.
- Ex-Dividend Date: The date when dividend eligibility expires is called the ex-dividend date, or ex-date for short. For example, if a stock's ex-dividend date is Monday, May 5, shareholders who purchase the stock on or after that date will not be eligible for the dividend. Shareholders who owned the stock before the ex-dividend date, i.e., on Friday, May 2 or earlier, are eligible for the distribution.
- Record Date: The record date is the cutoff date set by the company to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive dividends or distributions.
- Payment Date: The company pays dividends on the payment date, at which time the funds will be credited to investors' accounts.[8]2

## How Do Dividends Affect Stock Prices?

For example, if a company trading at $60 per share announces a $2 dividend on the announcement date. As the news becomes public, the stock price might rise by $2 to $62.

If the stock trades at $63 one business day before the ex-dividend date. On the ex-dividend date, it will adjust by $2 and begin trading at $61 at the start of the trading session on the ex-dividend date, because anyone who buys on the ex-dividend date will not receive the dividend.

## Why Do Companies Pay Dividends?

Shareholders typically expect dividends as a return on their investment in the company. Dividend payments have a positive impact on companies and help maintain investor confidence.

A high-value dividend declaration can indicate that a company is operating well and generating good profits. However, it may also suggest that the company lacks suitable projects to generate better returns in the future. Therefore, it uses its cash to pay shareholders rather than reinvesting it in growth.

A company with a long history of dividend payments may signal to investors that it is in trouble if it announces a reduction in dividend amount or cancels dividends. AT&T Inc. halved its annual dividend to $1.11 on February 1, 2022, and its stock price fell 4% that day.[9]10

However, reducing dividend amounts or deciding not to pay dividends doesn't necessarily mean bad news for a company. Company management may have a plan to invest the money, such as in a high-return project that has the potential to expand shareholder returns in the long term.

## Fund Dividends

Dividends paid by funds (such as bonds or mutual funds) differ from dividends paid by companies. Funds operate on the Net Asset Value (NAV) principle, which reflects the valuation of their holdings or the prices of assets in the fund's portfolio.[11]

Regular dividend payments should not be misinterpreted as superior performance of the fund. For example, a fund investing in bonds may pay dividends monthly because it receives interest from its interest-bearing holdings monthly, and simply transfers all or part of the interest income to the fund's investors.

A fund investing in stocks pays dividends either through earnings received from many stocks held in its portfolio or by selling a proportion of stocks and distributing capital gains.

## Are Dividends Irrelevant?

Economists Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani argued that a company's dividend policy is irrelevant and has no effect on either the company's stock price or its cost of capital. Shareholders might remain indifferent to a company's dividend policy, just as in the case of high dividend payments, investors can simply use the received cash to purchase more shares.

If dividend payments are low, investors can sell shares to generate the cash they need. In either case, the sum of the value of their investment in the company and the cash they hold will remain constant. Therefore, Miller and Modigliani concluded that dividends are irrelevant, and investors should not care about a company's dividend policy because they can synthesize it themselves.[12] However, dividends remain an attractive investment incentive, and shareholders can earn additional returns.

## How to Invest in Dividend-Paying Securities

Investors seeking dividend investments have multiple options, including stocks, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Dividend Discount Model or Gordon Growth Model can help in selecting stock investments. These techniques rely on expected future dividend streams to evaluate stock value.

To compare multiple stocks based on their dividend payment performance, investors can use the dividend yield factor, which measures dividends as a percentage of the company's current market stock price.

Dividend rates can be expressed as a dollar amount of dividends per share (DPS). In addition to dividend yield, another important performance indicator for evaluating returns generated by a specific investment is the total return factor. This figure takes into account interest, dividends, and stock price appreciation along with other capital gains.

Taxation is another important consideration when investing for dividend income. High-tax bracket investors often prefer dividend-paying stocks in jurisdictions that allow for zero or relatively low tax rates on dividends. For example, Greece and Slovakia impose lower taxes on shareholders' dividend income, while dividend earnings in Hong Kong are tax-free.[13]14

## How often are dividends distributed to shareholders?

Dividends are typically distributed to shareholders quarterly, though some companies may pay dividends semi-annually. Payments can be received either in cash form or in the form of reinvestment in company stock.

## What is an example of dividends?

If a company's board of directors decides to issue an annual dividend of 5% per share, and the company's stock is worth $100, then the dividend is $5. If dividends are issued quarterly, each distribution would be $1.25.

## Why Are Dividends Important?

While dividends can indicate that a company has stable cash flow and is generating profits, they can also provide regular income for investors. Dividend payments may also help provide insight into a company's intrinsic value. Many countries also offer preferential tax treatment for dividends, treating them as tax-exempt income.[15]16
