## What are Binary Options?

Binary options are financial derivatives that allow investors to make all-or-nothing bets on event outcomes and asset price movements, and their popularity has risen dramatically in recent years. However, critics, including U.S. regulators who have long warned investors, argue that these trades are more akin to gambling than investing and pose high risks of fraud and losses to unsuspecting consumers.

The outcomes of these options are based on "yes or no" propositions, hence the name "binary." If a binary option expires "in the money," the trader receives a profit; if it expires "out of the money," they lose their investment. In 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved binary options for exchange trading. Subsequently, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the North American Derivatives Exchange (Nadex) began offering standardized binary options for retail traders.

Although trading is possible on regulated exchanges, most binary options trading in the U.S. still occurs through unregulated offshore platforms, leading to numerous fraud cases.[1] Binary options are banned in many places globally, including Australia, Canada, Europe, and the UK.[3]

### Key Points

- Binary options are determined by a "yes or no" outcome.
- If a binary option expires "in-the-money," the trader receives a payout; if "out-of-the-money," they lose their investment.
- Binary options set fixed amounts for profit and loss.
- Binary options do not allow traders to hold positions in the underlying asset.
- Most binary options trading occurs on platforms outside the United States.

## How Binary Options Work

Binary options have an expiration date and time. At expiration, the price of the underlying asset or event must be on the correct side of the strike price set by the exchange for the trader to profit.

Binary options are automatically executed, meaning that when the option expires, the profit or loss from the trade is automatically credited to the trader's account. This means that investors who buy binary options will either receive a payout or lose their entire investment—there is no middle ground.

For example, suppose a trader bets that ABC's stock price will be above $25。假设客户认为在该日期和时间股价将高于$25 at 10:45 AM on April 22, 2021, and is willing to stake $100。如果ABC的股价在该时段交易高于$25 on this trade. The trader will receive payment according to the agreed terms. For instance, if the payout ratio is 70%, the binary options broker will credit $70。如果在该日期和时间股价低于$25 to the trader's account, and the client will incorrectly lose $100的投资。

因此，许多人发现二元期权比常规期权更易于理解，这也是其受欢迎的原因。由于存在风险，交易金额会受到限制，例如在Nadex期权交易所限制在约$2,500.[5]

## Comparison between Binary Options and Standard Options

### Binary Options and Standard Options

#### Binary Options

- Ownership Potential: Does not provide ownership of the underlying asset.
- Risk and Payout: Fixed maximum payout and losses limited to the option investment amount.
- Regulation: Usually traded on unregulated platforms, which may increase fraud risk.

#### Regular Options

- Ownership Potential: Provides potential ownership of the underlying asset.
- Risk and Payoff: Fixed risk, but profits vary with underlying asset price movements.
- Regulation: Traded on regulated U.S. exchanges, following U.S. market regulations.

Regular American options give holders the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a specified price on or before the expiration date. European options are similar, but traders can only exercise this right on the expiration date. Regular options, also known as vanilla options, grant buyers potential ownership of the underlying asset. When purchasing these options, traders have predetermined risk, but profits depend on the magnitude of price movements in the underlying asset.

Binary options differ in that they don't offer the possibility of holding positions in the underlying asset. In this respect, they are purely speculative. Binary options typically set fixed maximum payouts, while maximum risk is limited to the amount invested in the option. The underlying "assets" can be prices and events. Some binary options can be closed before expiration, but this usually reduces the payout received (if the option is "in-the-money").

Binary options occasionally trade on platforms regulated by the SEC and other agencies, but most binary options trading occurs outside the U.S. and is not regulated by U.S. officials. Unregulated binary options brokers are not required to meet specific standards or any standards at all. Therefore, investors should be very wary of potential scams. In contrast, regular options trade on regulated U.S. exchanges and follow U.S. options market regulations.[6]

## How to Trade Binary Options

When buying binary options, follow these steps:

- Understand the product: You should master the basic concepts of binary options, how they work, and the factors that determine their payouts.
- Broker research: Find a reputable binary options broker. For US traders, it's crucial to ensure the broker is regulated by the SEC.[7] Otherwise, your trading may be illegal.[8] If you're outside the US, you should check local regulations, but many countries prohibit this practice, leaving you exposed to often fraudulent applications that use many old but effective strategies to keep you betting funds.[9] It's best to avoid platforms that claim binary options trading is "low risk," offer free "bonuses" for registration or continued trading after losses, or offshore platforms. Verify them with the CFTC and other resources. Don't assume they're legitimate just because they appear to have free educational pages and reviews exploited by some experienced scam platforms.
- Set up a demo account: Many brokers offer demo trading accounts where traders can practice binary options with paper or virtual currency. While generally considered a risk-free way to familiarize yourself with the platform, many platforms will request your contact and financial information, and some offshore platforms have used this information for identity theft.[10]
- Develop a trading strategy: Decide which markets to buy contracts in, how much to invest, expiration times, and the type of binary options to trade.
- Open a real account: After this, you can open a real trading account. This requires providing more personal information, proof of identity and residence.
- Fund the account: Brokers typically require a minimum deposit to begin trading. This amount varies by broker.
- Start trading: You can begin purchasing contracts.
- Monitor and adjust trading strategy: You need to continuously monitor your trades and the market, and be prepared to adjust your strategy based on changing conditions.

When trading binary options, you should be aware of potential scam risks. It's important to note that many binary options platforms operate outside regulated financial markets. This lack of regulation can lead to higher fraud risks due to the absence of oversight.[11] Once a scam occurs, you're usually left very isolated with little recourse.

You must conduct thorough research, verify the broker's regulatory status, approach binary options trading with caution, and fully understand the risks and potential for fraud.

## Binary Options Example

An example is that the entry price of binary options represents potential profit or loss, with all options having an expiration value of $100或$0.

Suppose Colgate-Palmolive (CL) stock is trading at $64.75交易。一项二元期权的行权价格为$65, expiring tomorrow at noon. A trader can make $40购买该期权。如果股票价格在到期时超过$65, then the option expires "in-the-money" with a profit value of $100。交易者获得$60 ($100 - $40).

If the option expires with Colgate's price below $65（“价外”），则交易者会失去他们投入的$40. In binary options, the sum of potential profits and losses always equals $100。如果ABC的股价在该时段交易高于$0120, and increases the profit potential to $180.

## What do I need to open a binary options trading account?

This typically involves selecting a broker, submitting an application, completing customer identity verification forms, funding the account, and verifying your identity for the broker's use.[4]

## Are Binary Options Considered High Risk?

Binary options are considered high risk due to their all-or-nothing payouts, short-term speculative nature, volatility, and the leverage involved.

Therefore, one should exercise caution when dealing with binary options, fully understand the associated risks, and develop trading strategies with risk management measures. It is crucial to use regulated and reputable brokers to mitigate these risks.

## What is the Best Time to Trade Binary Options?

This largely depends on market conditions and the events or assets involved. The optimal trading time is related to the product's volatility, economic events, data releases, and market liquidity.[4]

## Conclusion

Binary options are financial derivatives that provide traders with either a fixed payout or no payout based on the outcome of a "yes or no" proposition. Traders bet whether the price of the underlying asset will be above or below a certain level at a specific time, directly resulting in two distinct outcomes: a predetermined payout or a complete loss of the investment amount.

When the underlying asset is a financial instrument, traders participate in the market in a unique way. However, they carry significant risks, primarily due to their all-or-nothing nature and the presence of numerous unregulated platforms. Therefore, before committing capital to the market through binary options trading, it is advisable to thoroughly understand market conditions, develop sound trading strategies, and clearly recognize the associated risks.
