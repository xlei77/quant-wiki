## What is Gross National Product (GNP)?

Gross National Product (GNP) is an estimate of the total value of all final products and services produced by production factors owned by a country's residents during a specific period.[1] GNP is typically calculated by adding personal consumption expenditure, private domestic investment, government spending, net exports, and any income earned by residents from overseas investments, then subtracting income earned by foreign residents. Net exports represent the difference between a country's exports and imports of goods and services.

GNP is related to another important economic indicatorâ€”Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which considers all output produced within a country's borders, regardless of who owns the production factors. GNP starts with GDP, adds investment income earned by residents from overseas investments, and subtracts investment income earned by foreign residents within a country's borders.[1]

### Key Points

- GNP measures the output of a country's residents, regardless of where the actual underlying economic activity takes place.
- A country's residents' overseas investment income is included in GNP, while foreign investments within the country are not. This contrasts with GDP, which measures economic output and income based on location rather than nationality.
- GNP and GDP can have different values, and a large difference between a country's GNP and GDP may indicate a high degree of integration with the global economy.

## Understanding Gross National Product (GNP)

GNP measures the total monetary value of output produced by a country's residents. Therefore, when calculating GNP, any output produced by foreign residents within the country must be excluded, while any output produced by the country's residents abroad must be included.

GNP does not include intermediate goods and services to avoid double counting, as they are already included in the value of final goods and services.

The United States used GNP as its primary measure of economic activity until 1991. After that, it began replacing it with GDP for two reasons. [2] First, GDP correlates more closely with other economic data of interest to U.S. policymakers (such as employment and industrial production), which, like GDP, measure activity within U.S. borders regardless of nationality. Second, the switch to GDP was made to facilitate international comparisons, as most other countries primarily used GDP at the time. [3]

## Differences between GNP and GDP

GNP and GDP are very closely related concepts. The main difference between them lies in the possibility of foreign-owned companies producing goods within a country, and domestically-owned companies producing goods for the rest of the world and repatriating the earned income to domestic residents.

For example, many foreign companies produce goods and services in the United States and transfer any earned income to their foreign residents. Similarly, many U.S. companies produce goods and services outside the U.S. and earn profits for U.S. residents. If the income earned by domestic companies outside the U.S. exceeds the income earned by foreign-owned companies within the U.S., then America's GNP is higher than its GDP.

Calculating GNP and GDP can yield different total output results. For instance, in 2021 (based on third-quarter data), U.S. GDP was $23.8 trillion, while its GNP was $23.9 trillion.[4]

While GDP is the most widely used measure of a country's economic activity, GNP remains noteworthy because significant differences between GNP and GDP may indicate that a country is increasingly participating in international trade, production, or financial operations. The larger the difference between a country's GNP and GDP, the greater the extent to which that country's income and investment activities involve transnational activities (such as foreign direct investment).

## What Does Gross National Product Measure?

Gross National Product is an indicator that measures a country's economic output. Gross National Product is the value of all goods and services produced by a country's citizens both domestically and internationally, minus the income earned by foreign residents. For example, if a country has production facilities in both neighboring countries and domestically, the Gross National Product will include the output from both productions.

## What is the difference between GNP and GDP?

Gross National Product (GNP) includes production by its citizens both within and outside its borders. This figure is then reduced by the income earned by foreign residents within the country. In contrast, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the total goods and services produced within a country's borders by both citizens and foreign residents. [1]

## What is an example of Gross National Product?

Consider a country where the Gross National Product exceeds its Gross Domestic Product. This indicates that its citizens, enterprises, and corporations are providing net inflows to the country through their overseas operations. Therefore, this higher GNP may suggest that a country is expanding its international financial operations, trade, or production.
