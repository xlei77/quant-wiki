## What is Absolute Advantage?

Absolute advantage refers to the ability of an individual, company, region, or country to produce more goods or services with the same amount of input in a given time period, or to produce the same amount of goods or services with less input in a given time period, thus surpassing their competitors.

Absolute advantage can be achieved by producing goods or services at a lower absolute unit cost with fewer inputs, or through more efficient processes.

### Key Points

- Absolute advantage refers to when a producer can provide more goods or services at the same cost, or provide the same quantity of goods or services at a lower cost, thus surpassing their competitors.
- Absolute advantage is a concept introduced by Adam Smith, which can serve as the foundation for large-scale trade between producers of different goods who have absolute advantages in different products.[1]
- Through specialization, division of labor, and trade, producers with different absolute advantages can always achieve greater benefits than they would through isolated production and consumption.
- Absolute advantage can be contrasted with comparative advantage, which refers to the ability to produce goods and services at a lower **opportunity cost**.

## Understanding Absolute Advantage

The concept of absolute advantage was introduced by 18th-century economist Adam Smith in his work "The Wealth of Nations," aimed at explaining how countries can benefit from trade by specializing in producing and exporting goods that they can produce more efficiently than other countries. Countries with absolute advantage can choose to specialize in producing and selling specific goods or services, and use the resulting funds to purchase goods and services from other countries.

Smith argued that when countries specialize in products where they have absolute advantages and then trade, all countries can become better off, as long as each has absolute advantage in at least one product relative to other countries.

Absolute advantage explains why trade makes sense between individuals, businesses, and nations. Since each entity has advantages in producing certain goods and services, both parties can benefit from exchange.

This mutual benefit from trade forms the foundation of Smith's argument that specialization, division of labor, and subsequent trade lead to an increase in overall prosperity from which everyone can benefit. Smith considered this to be the fundamental source of the eponymous "wealth of nations."[1]

## Absolute Advantage and Comparative Advantage

Absolute advantage can be contrasted with comparative advantage, which refers to when a producer can produce goods or services at a lower opportunity cost than other producers. Opportunity cost refers to the potential benefits that individuals, investors, or businesses forgo when choosing one alternative over another.[2]

Absolute advantage only leads to clear specialization and trade gains when each producer has absolute advantages in producing certain goods. If producers lack any absolute advantages, then Adam Smith's argument may not necessarily apply.

However, producers and their trading partners can still benefit from trade if they specialize according to their comparative advantages.[3] David Ricardo pointed out in his work "Principles of Political Economy and Taxation" that even if a country has absolute advantages in trading multiple goods, it can still benefit from trading with other countries if it has different comparative advantages.[4]

## Assumptions of Absolute Advantage Theory

Both Smith's absolute advantage theory and Ricardo's comparative advantage theory rely on certain assumptions and simplifications to explain the benefits of trade.[4]1

Both theories assume there are no trade barriers. They do not take into account any transportation costs or additional tariffs that one country might impose on imported goods from another.[4]1 However, in the real world, transportation costs affect the possibility of importers and exporters conducting trade. Countries can also use tariffs to create advantages for themselves or disadvantages for competitors.

Both theories also assume that factors of production are immobile. In these models, workers and businesses do not relocate in search of better opportunities. This assumption was realistic in the 18th century.

However, in modern trade, globalization has made it easy for companies to move factories overseas. It has also increased migration rates, which affects the labor force available to a country. In some industries, businesses will work with governments to create immigration opportunities for workers who are crucial to their operations.

More importantly, both theories assume that a country's absolute advantage is constant and uniform in scale. In other words, it assumes that the unit cost of producing a small quantity of goods is the same as producing a large quantity, and that countries cannot change their absolute advantage.

In reality, countries often make strategic investments to create greater advantages in certain industries. Absolute advantages can also change for reasons beyond investment. For example, natural disasters can destroy farmland, factories, and other factors of production.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Absolute Advantage

One advantage of the absolute advantage theory is its simplicity: the theory provides an elegant explanation for the benefits of trade, demonstrating how countries can benefit by focusing on their absolute advantages.

However, the absolute advantage theory does not fully explain why countries benefit from trade. This explanation would later be attributed to Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage: even if a country has absolute advantages in both types of goods, it can still become better off through trade. In other words, if a country can produce all goods more cheaply than its trading partners, it can still benefit from trading with other countries.

Furthermore, as explained earlier, the theory also assumes that absolute advantages are staticâ€”a country cannot change its absolute advantage, and they don't become more efficient with scale. Real experience shows this is not true: many countries have successfully created absolute advantages through investment in strategic industries.[3]

In fact, the theory has been used to justify exploitative economic policies in the post-colonial era. With the notion that all countries should focus on their advantages, major institutions like the World Bank and IMF often forced developing countries to focus on agricultural exports rather than industrialization. As a result, many of these countries remain at lower levels of economic development.[5]6

## Example of Absolute Advantage

Consider two hypothetical countries, Atlantica and Pacifica, with identical populations and resource endowments, each producing two products: butter and bacon. Each year, Atlantica can produce either 12 barrels of butter or 6 slabs of bacon, while Pacifica can produce either 6 barrels of butter or 12 slabs of bacon.

Each country needs at least 4 barrels of butter and 4 slabs of bacon to survive. In a state of self-sufficiency, producing only to meet their own needs, Atlantica can spend one-third of the year making butter and two-thirds making bacon, producing a total of 4 barrels of butter and 4 slabs of bacon.

Pacifica can spend one-third of the year making bacon and two-thirds making butter to produce the same output: 4 barrels of butter and 4 slabs of bacon. This leaves each country at the edge of survival, with barely enough butter and bacon to sustain themselves. However, note that Atlantica has an absolute advantage in producing butter, while Pacifica has an absolute advantage in producing bacon.

If each country specializes in production according to its absolute advantage, Atlantica can produce 12 barrels of butter and no bacon in a year, while Pacifica can produce 12 slabs of bacon and no butter. Through specialization, the two countries divide the labor tasks.

If they then trade 6 barrels of butter for 6 slabs of bacon, each country will have 6 barrels of butter and 6 slabs of bacon. Now both countries are better off than before, as each country will have 6 barrels of butter and 6 slabs of bacon instead of the 4 units of each commodity they could produce on their own.

## How Does Absolute Advantage Benefit a Country?

The concept of absolute advantage, introduced by Adam Smith in "The Wealth of Nations," explains how countries can benefit from trade by specializing in producing and exporting goods they can produce more efficiently than other countries, while importing goods that other countries can produce more efficiently. Specializing in and trading products where they have absolute advantage can benefit both countries, as long as each has absolute advantage in at least one product relative to the other country.[1]

## What is the difference between absolute advantage and comparative advantage?

Absolute advantage refers to an entity's ability to produce a product or service using fewer inputs or more efficient processes at a lower absolute unit cost than another entity producing the same good or service. Comparative advantage refers to the ability to produce goods and services at a lower opportunity cost, not necessarily in greater quantity or quality.[2]3

## Which Countries Have Examples of Absolute Advantage?

Saudi Arabia is a clear example of absolute advantage, with its abundant oil supplies giving it an absolute advantage over other countries. [7]

Other examples include Colombia with its climate - which is perfect for growing coffee - and Zambia, which has the world's richest copper mines. [8]9 For Saudi Arabia to attempt growing coffee, or for Colombia to attempt drilling for oil, would be extremely expensive and likely unproductive ventures.

## Conclusion

The theory of absolute advantage represents Adam Smith's explanation of why countries benefit from trade by exporting goods in which they have an absolute advantage and importing other goods. While this theory provides an elegant and simple explanation of the benefits of trade, it does not fully explain the advantages of international trade. This would later be attributed to David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage.[1]4
