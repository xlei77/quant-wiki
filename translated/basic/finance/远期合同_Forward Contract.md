## What is a Forward Contract?

A forward contract is a customized agreement between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a future date. Forward contracts can be used for hedging or speculation, although their non-standardized nature makes them particularly suitable for hedging.

### Key Points

- A forward contract is a customizable derivative contract signed between two parties, agreeing to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a future date.
- Forward contracts can be adjusted according to specific commodities, quantities, and delivery dates.
- Forward contracts are not traded on centralized exchanges and are therefore considered over-the-counter (OTC) instruments.
- For example, forward contracts can help producers and users of agricultural products hedge against price fluctuation risks of the underlying asset or commodity.
- Financial institutions initiating forward contracts face higher settlement and default risks compared to contracts that are marked-to-market periodically.

## Understanding Forward Contracts

Unlike standard futures contracts, forward contracts can be customized in terms of commodity, quantity, and delivery date. Tradable commodities include grains, precious metals, natural gas, oil, and even poultry. According to contract specifications, forward contracts can be settled either in cash or by physical delivery.

Forward contracts are not traded on centralized exchanges and are therefore considered over-the-counter (OTC) instruments. While their OTC nature facilitates customization of terms, the lack of a central clearinghouse also results in higher counterparty risk.

**Important Note:** Due to their potential counterparty risk and lack of a central clearinghouse, forward contracts are not as readily available as futures contracts and are more difficult for retail investors to access.

## Forward Contracts and Futures Contracts

Forward contracts and futures contracts both involve agreements to buy or sell commodities at a fixed price in the future, but there are some subtle differences between the two. Forward contracts are not traded on exchanges, while futures contracts are.

Forward contracts are settled at the end of the contract period, while futures contracts are settled daily. Most importantly, futures contracts are standardized contracts with no customization between parties. [1]

## Forward Contract Example

Consider the following example of a forward contract. Suppose an agricultural producer has 2 million bushels of corn to sell in six months, but is worried about a potential decline in corn prices. Therefore, he enters into a forward contract with his financial institution, agreeing to sell 2 million bushels of corn at $4.30 per bushel in six months, with cash settlement.

After six months, there are three possible scenarios for the spot price of corn:

## Forward Contract Risks

The forward contract market is enormous because many large corporations worldwide use it to hedge currency and interest rate risks. However, since the details of forward contracts are limited to buyers and sellers, making it difficult for the public to access information, the size of this market is challenging to estimate.

The massive scale of the forward contract market and its unregulated nature mean that, in the worst-case scenario, it could experience a series of chain defaults. Although banks and financial institutions reduce risk by carefully selecting counterparties, the possibility of large-scale defaults still exists.

Another risk stemming from the non-standardized nature of forward contracts is that they are only settled on the settlement date, unlike futures contracts which are marked-to-market regularly. How should situations be handled when there is a significant difference between the forward rate specified in the contract and the spot rate at settlement?

In such cases, financial institutions initiating forward contracts face higher risks compared to contracts that are regularly marked-to-market, which increases the risk of customer default or non-settlement.
