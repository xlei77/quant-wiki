## What is the Discount Rate?

The discount rate is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve charges commercial banks and other financial institutions for short-term loans. The discount rate applies to the Federal Reserve's lending facility, known as the discount window.

The discount rate can also refer to the interest rate used in Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis to determine the present value of future cash flows. In this context, investors and businesses can use the discount rate to evaluate potential investments.

### Key Points

- In banking, the discount rate is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve charges banks for short-term loans.
- Discount lending is a key monetary policy tool and part of the Fed's role as the lender of last resort.
- In discounted cash flow analysis, the discount rate is the rate used to discount future cash flows.
- The discount rate in DCF represents the time value of money and can determine whether an investment project is financially viable.
- As long as you know the future value, present value, and total number of years, you can calculate the discount rate in DCF.

## How the Federal Reserve Discount Rate Works

Commercial banks in the United States have two main ways to borrow money to meet their short-term operational needs. They can use market-driven interbank rates to borrow and lend to other banks without requiring any collateral, or they can borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank to meet their short-term operational needs.

Federal Reserve Bank lending is processed through the Fed's 12 regional branches. Financial institutions use these loans to cover any cash shortfalls, avoid any liquidity issues, or, in worst-case scenarios, prevent bank failures. This lending facility provided by the Federal Reserve is known as the discount window.

These loans are very short-term: 24 hours or less. The rate charged is the standard discount rate. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors sets this discount rate. [1]

The Fed's discount window program operates three tiers of lending, each using a separate but related rate. It also allows for emergency credit approval for troubled banks.

The Federal Reserve independently determines the discount rates for the first two tiers. The third tier's rate is based on prevailing market rates.

- First Tier: Known as the primary credit program, this tier provides funds to banks in good financial condition with sound credit records. This primary credit discount rate is typically set above existing market rates that might be available from other banks or similar short-term debt sources.
- Second Tier: Known as the secondary credit program, it provides similar loans to institutions that don't qualify for the primary rate. It is typically 50 basis points higher than the primary rate (one percentage point = 100 basis points). Institutions at this tier are smaller and may not be as financially healthy as those using the primary tier.
- Third Tier: Known as the seasonal credit program, it serves small financial institutions with large seasonal fluctuations in cash flow. Many are regional banks serving agriculture and tourism. Their business is considered relatively higher risk, so they pay higher rates.
- Emergency Credit: Banks applying for emergency credit must prove they cannot get a loan from another bank and need votes of support from at least five Federal Reserve Board governors. [1]

**Important Note:** All three types of Federal Reserve discount window loans are collateralized. Banks need to maintain certain levels of security or collateral to support the loans. Emergency credit may require collateral, but this is based on specific circumstances and Fed voting.

Borrowing institutions rarely use this facility, primarily when they cannot find willing lenders in the market. The discount rates offered by the Fed are relatively high compared to interbank borrowing rates to discourage too frequent use of the discount window.

The discount window primarily serves as an emergency option for troubled banks—borrowing from it may even signal weakness to other market participants and investors.

## Federal Reserve Discount Rate Example

As financial conditions deteriorated sharply and central banks took measures to inject liquidity into the financial system, the use of the Federal Reserve's discount window surged in late 2007 and 2008.

In August 2007, the Board reduced the primary discount rate from 6.25% to 5.75%, lowering the premium above the federal funds rate from 1% to 0.5%. In October 2008, the month after Lehman Brothers' collapse, discount window borrowing peaked at $403.5 billion, compared to a monthly average of $0.7 billion from 1959 to 2006.

Due to the financial crisis, the Board extended the lending term from overnight to 30 days, and then to 90 days in March 2008. [2] Once the economy recovered, these temporary measures were withdrawn, and the discount rate returned to overnight lending only.

The Federal Reserve maintains its own discount rate under the discount window program in the United States. Most central banks globally use similar measures, although they vary by region. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) offers standing facilities that serve the same purpose. Financial institutions can obtain overnight liquidity from the central bank in exchange for providing sufficient eligible assets as collateral. [3]

**Note:** Most commonly, Federal Reserve discount window loans are overnight only, but during periods of extreme economic distress, such as during the 2008-2009 credit crisis, the lending term can be extended.

## How Discount Rates Work in Cash Flow Analysis

The same term "discount rate" is also used in Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis. DCF is used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. Based on the concept of time value of money, DCF analysis helps evaluate the feasibility of a project or investment by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows using a discount rate.

This analysis begins by estimating the investment required for the proposed project. Then, it considers the future returns it is expected to generate. Using the discount rate, the current value of any future cash flow can be calculated. If the net Present Value (PV) is positive, the project is considered viable. If negative, the project is not worth investing in.

In this context of DCF analysis, the discount rate refers to the interest rate used to determine the present value. For example, investing $100 today in a savings plan with a 10% interest rate will grow to $110. In other words, $110, the Future Value (FV), when discounted at a 10% rate, is equivalent to $100 today (Present Value).

If one knows (or can reasonably predict) all these future cash flows (such as the future value of $110), then, using a specific discount rate, the present value of this investment can be obtained.

## What Discount Rate Should Be Used?

For investment or business projects, what discount rate should be used? When investing in standard assets (such as Treasury bills), the risk-free rate of return (typically considered to be the three-month Treasury bill rate) is commonly used as the discount rate.

On the other hand, if a company is evaluating the feasibility of potential projects, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) can be used as the discount rate. This is the average cost of capital that a company pays for borrowing or selling equity.

In either case, for an investment or project to be approved, the net present value of all cash flows should be positive.

## Types of Discounted Cash Flows

There are different types of discount rates applicable to various corporate investments. The required type depends on the needs and requirements of both investors and the company itself. Here are the most common ones:

- Cost of Debt: Companies must take on debt to fund their operations and maintain business activities. The interest rate they pay for this debt is called the cost of debt.
- Cost of Equity: The cost of equity is the rate companies use to compensate shareholders. Investors expect a specific rate of return in exchange for taking on the risk of investing in the company.
- Hurdle Rate: The minimum rate of return for a specific investment or venture is called the hurdle rate. This allows them to make significant decisions about whether the venture is appropriate.
- Risk-free Rate: The risk-free rate is the rate of return that comes with no risk from an investment or business venture.
- Weighted Average Cost of Capital: This is the rate of return that investors expect to earn on their capital. Investors can include equity shareholders and bondholders.

## Calculating the Discount Rate

To calculate the discount rate, use the following formula:

Where:

- FV = Future Value of the cash flow
- PV = Present Value
- (n) = Number of years to FV

Here's an example demonstrating how the discount rate works. Suppose you want to determine the discount rate for a specific investment using these variables:

|Future Value|$5,000
|---|---|
|现值|$3,500
|Number of Years|10

Now, let's use the formula above to determine the discount rate. For fractional exponents, you can convert to decimal (1 ÷ 10):

DR = ( FV ÷ PV ) 1/n - 1
DR = ( $5,000 ÷ $3,500 ) 1/10 - 1
DR = $1.42857 0.1 - 1
DR = 1.03631 - 1
DR = 0.03631

Therefore, in this case, the discount rate is 3.631%.

## What effect does a higher discount rate have on the time value of money?

A discount rate reduces future cash flows, so the higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of future cash flows. Lower discount rates result in higher present values. As this implies, when discount rates are high, money in the future will be worth less than it is today—meaning it will have less purchasing power.

## How to Calculate Discounted Cash Flow?

There are three steps to calculate the DCF of an investment:

- Forecast the expected cash flows of the investment.
- Select an appropriate discount rate.
- Discount the projected cash flows back to the present using a financial calculator, spreadsheet, or manual calculation.

## How to Choose an Appropriate Discount Rate?

The discount rate used depends on the type of analysis being conducted. When considering investments, investors should use the opportunity cost of putting their money elsewhere as the appropriate discount rate. This is the rate of return that investors could obtain from investments of comparable size and risk in the market.

Companies can choose the most appropriate from several discount rates. This could be a discount rate based on opportunity cost, their weighted average cost of capital, or the historical average return rate of similar projects. In some cases, using the risk-free rate might be most appropriate.

## Bottom Line

The discount rate is the interest rate at which banks can borrow from the Federal Reserve's discount window if they are unable to obtain funds from another bank in the market. The discount rate can also be used in discounted cash flow models to make business or investment decisions.
