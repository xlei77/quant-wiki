## What is Hyperinflation?

Hyperinflation refers to a phenomenon in an economy where general prices rise rapidly, excessively, and uncontrollably. While inflation measures the rate at which prices of goods and services increase, hyperinflation is rapidly accelerating inflation, typically defined as exceeding 50% per month.

Although hyperinflation is a rare event for developed economies, it has historically occurred in many countries, such as China, Germany, Russia, Hungary, and Georgia.

### Key Points

- Hyperinflation refers to rapid and uncontrolled price increases in an economy, typically exceeding 50% per month over a period of time.
- Hyperinflation can occur in situations affecting the underlying productive economy, accompanied by excessive money printing by central banks.
- Hyperinflation leads to soaring prices of necessities such as food and fuel, as demand exceeds supply.
- While instances of hyperinflation are relatively rare, once they begin, they can become uncontrollable.

## Understanding Hyperinflation

Inflation is measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to gauge the purchasing power of the dollar. The CPI is a price index of approximately 94,000 goods and services; quotes from about 8,000 rental housing units; and prices for airline tickets, clothing, household items, prescription drugs, used cars, and postage.[1]

Generally, the Federal Reserve strives to maintain what it calls a healthy inflation rate of about 2% over the long term.[2] Hyperinflation is an extreme case of inflation, not just high inflation. Inflation above 5% is considered high inflation. Monthly inflation of 50% or higher is considered hyperinflation.[3]

**Note:** For comparison, U.S. inflation as measured by CPI averaged approximately 2.5% annually from 2013 to 2022. The average from June to April 2023 was 5.55%.[4]

In a hyperinflationary environment, prices can rise daily or weekly, which has a dramatic impact on consumers' ability to purchase basic necessities. For example, suppose you always buy the same items at the grocery store. If an economy is experiencing a 5% daily increase in inflation rate, your grocery bill might go from $500 one week to $675 the next week, then up to $911 the following week.

## Causes of Hyperinflation

While several situations can trigger hyperinflation, the following are the most common causes of hyperinflation.

Central banks typically control the circulating money supply. In historical situations where increasing the money supply was necessary—such as during economic recessions or depressions—central banks can increase money circulation. The intention behind this move is to encourage bank lending and promote borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses.

However, if the increase in money supply is not supported by economic growth (measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP)), it can lead to hyperinflation. If GDP (which measures an economy's production) doesn't grow, businesses raise prices to increase profits and maintain survival.

As consumers have more money, they pay higher prices and fuel inflation. If economic output continues to stagnate or shrink while inflation rates keep rising, companies charge more, consumers pay more, and central banks print more money. A cycle of continuously rising inflation rates emerges, leading to hyperinflation.

Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand is too high relative to aggregate supply. This rapidly drives up prices because there aren't enough goods and services to meet the overall increase in demand from consumers and businesses.

**Important Note:** Hyperinflation is the product of multiple circumstances and poor monetary decisions working together.

## Effects of Hyperinflation

Hyperinflation can lead to several adverse consequences. People may begin hoarding goods, such as food. In turn, this could result in food supply shortages.

When prices rise excessively, the value of currency decreases as inflation erodes its purchasing power. Reduced purchasing power means consumers spend more to buy less. Consequently, they have less money available to pay bills and purchase necessities.

Furthermore, people may refrain from depositing money in financial institutions, leading to the collapse of banks and lending institutions. Tax revenues may also decline if consumers and businesses become unable to pay, resulting in the government's inability to provide basic services.

## How to Prepare for Hyperinflation

It is crucial to remember that hyperinflation does not occur frequently, especially in developed countries during periods when central banks focus on controlling inflation. However, you can take several measures to reduce the impact of normal or high inflation on your portfolio.

A balanced and diversified portfolio can help you minimize losses during inflationary periods. Commodities and real estate can reduce the adverse effects of inflation because they tend to appreciate in value during these periods. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) can hedge against rising inflation risks because the principal you invest in TIPS adjusts with inflation.

Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that practice inflation swaps can also be used to combat the effects of inflation on your portfolio.

## Real Cases of Hyperinflation

The hyperinflation that occurred in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s was one of the more destructive and prolonged events. When the country was on the brink of dissolution, it had already experienced inflation rates exceeding 76% annually.[5]

In 1991, it was discovered that the then-leader of Serbia, Slobodan Milošević, had plundered the treasury by having the Serbian Central Bank issue $1.4 billion in loans to his associates.[5]

The theft forced the government's central bank to print excessive money to handle its fiscal obligations. As a result, hyperinflation quickly swept through the economy, erasing the country's remaining wealth and forcing its people to barter for goods. The inflation rate nearly doubled daily until it reached a staggering 313,000,000% per month.[6]

The government quickly took control of production and wages, leading to food shortages. As a result, incomes fell by more than 50%, and production came to a halt. Eventually, the government replaced its currency with the German Mark, which helped stabilize the economy.[7][8]

After World War II, Hungary experienced hyperinflation. At its peak, prices in Hungary rose by 207% daily.[6]

Zimbabwe entered a period of hyperinflation in March 2007, with daily inflation rates reaching 98% until early 2009.[6] The country's hyperinflationary period began in 1999, following multiple droughts and subsequent GDP decline.

As a result, the country was forced to borrow more than it produced, and the government began increasing spending. It raised taxes to pay bonuses to veterans of the independence war, participated in the Congo War, and borrowed from the International Monetary Fund to improve citizens' development and living standards.

The government began printing money to pay for these expenses, leading to rising inflation, and residents began relocating to other countries to escape the economic hardship. By 2010, millions had left the country, and the economy was in chaos.[9]

## What Happens If Hyperinflation Occurs?

Hyperinflation does not occur without warning signs. In the United States, if economists see signs of hyperinflation, the Federal Reserve will implement any permitted monetary policy tools to ensure it doesn't happen. This occurs long before inflation reaches a rate of 50%. In the past, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker raised interest rates to over 21% to combat rates exceeding 14%—leading to two recessions before inflation was brought under control.[10]11

## Will the United States Experience Hyperinflation?

Unless economic conditions become extremely severe, the United States is unlikely to experience hyperinflation. The Federal Reserve and the government have many tools at their disposal to prevent hyperinflation from occurring.

## What was the worst hyperinflation in history?

Hungary experienced hyperinflation from August 1945 to July 1946, with a daily inflation rate of 207%.[6]

## Bottom Line

Hyperinflation refers to a situation where a country's inflation rate rises by 50% or more within a month. It is different from a country merely experiencing high inflation; 5% is considered high inflation.

Hyperinflation drives up consumer prices and makes it difficult or impossible for a country to meet its fiscal obligations or produce goods and services. It leads to rapid price increases in daily necessities, making it difficult for consumers to afford them. However, hyperinflation does not occur frequently and usually has causes, such as war, natural disasters, or political corruption.
