## What is Economies of Scale?

Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages that companies gain when production becomes more efficient. Companies can achieve economies of scale by increasing output and reducing costs. This occurs because costs are spread across a larger number of goods. Costs can be either fixed costs or variable costs.

### Key Points

- Economies of scale refer to the cost advantages companies gain when production becomes more efficient, as costs can be spread across a larger number of goods.
- A company's size is related to its ability to achieve economies of scale—larger companies will have more cost savings and higher output.
- Economies of scale can be internal or external. Internal economies of scale are caused by factors within a single company, while external factors affect the entire industry.

## Understanding Economies of Scale

Typically, a company's size is crucial for economies of scale. The larger the enterprise, the greater the cost savings. Economies of scale can be either internal or external. Internal economies of scale are based on management decisions, while external economies of scale are related to external factors.

Internal functions include accounting, information technology, and marketing, which are also considered operational efficiencies and synergies.

Economies of scale is an important concept for any business in any industry, representing the cost savings and competitive advantages that large enterprises have over smaller ones.

Most consumers don't understand why a small business charges higher prices for similar products compared to large companies. This is because unit costs depend on the company's output. Large companies can increase production by spreading production costs across more goods. If several different companies produce similar goods within the same industry, the industry may also be able to determine the cost of products.

There are several reasons why economies of scale can reduce unit costs. First, labor specialization and more integrated technology increase output. Second, lower unit costs may come from bulk orders from suppliers, larger advertising purchases, or lower capital costs. Third, spreading internal function costs across more units of production and sales helps reduce costs.

**Important Note:** When a company becomes too large and pursues economies of scale, diseconomies of scale may occur. [1]

## Internal Economies of Scale vs. External Economies of Scale

As mentioned above, there are two different types of economies of scale.

- Internal economies of scale: originate from within the company, due to changes in how that company operates or produces goods
- External economies of scale: based on factors that affect the entire industry rather than individual companies

Internal economies of scale occur when a company cuts costs internally, making them unique to that particular company. This may be due to the company's large size or decisions made by company management. There are different types of internal economies of scale. These include:

- Technical: large-scale machinery or production processes that increase productivity
- Purchasing: reduced costs due to bulk buying
- Managerial: hiring specialists to oversee and improve different parts of the production process
- Risk-bearing: spreading risk across multiple investors
- Financial: higher creditworthiness, leading to increased access to capital and better interest rates
- Marketing: greater advertising power spread across larger markets and negotiating position within the market

Larger companies are typically able to achieve internal economies of scale—reducing costs and increasing output—for example, because they can purchase resources in bulk, have patents or special technology, or access more capital.

On the other hand, external economies of scale are achieved due to external factors or factors that affect the entire industry. This means no single company can control costs on their own. This occurs when there are highly skilled labor forces, subsidies and/or tax breaks, and partnerships and joint ventures—anything that can reduce costs for many companies within a specific industry.

## Limitations of Economies of Scale

For decades, management techniques and technology have focused on the limitations of economies of scale.

Due to more flexible technology, setup costs are lower. Equipment prices more closely match production capacity, allowing smaller producers like mini steel mills and craft breweries to compete more easily.

Outsourced functional services make costs more similar across businesses of various sizes. These functional services include accounting, human resources, marketing, finance, legal, and information technology.

Micro-manufacturing, ultra-local manufacturing, and additive manufacturing (3D printing) can reduce setup and production costs. Global trade and logistics help reduce costs regardless of individual factory scale.

According to the International Monetary Fund, the prices of capital goods and machinery equipment costs have been declining over the past thirty years in emerging, developed, and even industrial nations.[2]

## Examples of Economies of Scale

In hospitals, while doctor consultations still require 20 minutes, the hospital system's administrative costs are spread across more consultations, and doctors are now assisted by technicians or nursing assistants rather than degree-holding nurses.

Workshop production lines manufacture products in batches, such as shirts with company logos. Setup cost is a significant factor. In workshops, larger production runs reduce unit costs because the setup costs for designing logos and creating screen patterns are spread across more shirts. In assembly plants, unit costs are reduced by using more seamless technology with robots.

Restaurant kitchens are commonly used to illustrate how economies of scale can be limited: more chefs in a small space interfere with each other. In economic diagrams, this is illustrated with a U-shaped curve, where average unit costs first decrease and then increase. The rising costs that come with increased output are known as "diseconomies of scale."

## What is Economies of Scale?

Economies of scale are advantages that sometimes emerge from expanding a company's scale of operations. For example, companies may enjoy economies of scale in bulk purchasing. By purchasing large quantities of products at once, they can negotiate lower unit prices than their competitors.

## What Causes Economies of Scale?

Generally, economies of scale can be achieved in two ways. First, companies can achieve internal economies of scale by reorganizing how their resources (such as equipment and personnel) are allocated and utilized within the company. Second, companies can achieve external economies of scale by expanding their scale relative to competitors and leveraging this increased scale for competitive activities, such as negotiating volume discounts on bulk purchases.

## Why are Economies of Scale Important?

Economies of scale are important because they can help businesses gain competitive advantages in their industries. As a result, companies will try to achieve economies of scale whenever possible, just as investors try to identify economies of scale when making investment decisions. A particularly well-known example of economies of scale is known as the network effect.
