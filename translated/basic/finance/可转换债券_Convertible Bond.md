## What is a Convertible Bond?

A convertible bond is a fixed-income corporate debt security that provides interest payments but can be converted into a predetermined number of common shares or equity. The conversion of bonds into stocks can occur at specific times during the bond's life, typically at the bondholder's discretion.

As a hybrid security, convertible bond prices are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates, underlying stock prices, and the issuer's credit rating.

### Key Points

- Convertible bonds pay fixed interest income but can be converted into a predetermined number of common shares.
- Bond conversion occurs at specific times during the bond's life, typically at the bondholder's discretion.
- Convertible bonds provide investors with a hybrid security that features bond interest payments while also offering the option to own the underlying stock.

## Understanding Convertible Bonds

Convertible bonds provide companies with a flexible financing option. They not only have the interest payment function of bonds but also offer investors the opportunity to own stocks. The conversion ratio of these bonds determines how many shares can be obtained from converting one bond. For example, a 5:1 ratio means one bond can be converted into five common shares.

The conversion price is the per-share price at which convertible securities (such as corporate bonds or preferred shares) can be converted into common stock. The conversion price is set when determining the conversion ratio and can typically be found in the terms of the convertible bond or the prospectus of preferred shares. We will discuss how to calculate the conversion ratio later in this article.

If interest rates are favorable, bond issuers may also force or exercise their call rights. Mandatory conversion means investors have no right to choose whether to hold or convert the bonds.

One form of convertible bonds is known as "death spiral debt." In this case, the bonds pay out in stock at a fixed dollar value. If the stock price drops significantly, investors holding these convertible bonds will choose to convert their debt holdings. This action may further dilute the stock and lead to further decline in share price.

**Note:** Investors don't necessarily have to convert convertible bonds; they can choose to hold them until maturity, at which point they perform similarly to regular bonds.

## Comparison between Convertible Bonds and Regular Bonds

Convertible bonds and regular bonds share many similarities but also have differences. Besides the conversion feature, there are several notable distinctions worth mentioning.

First, convertible bondholders can participate in the company's equity. While regular bonds serve only as debt instruments, convertible bonds provide investors with opportunities to benefit from stock appreciation.

Second, due to the potential value of converting to equity, convertible bonds typically offer lower interest rates compared to regular bonds. In contrast, regular bonds offer higher interest rates to compensate investors for the lack of equity appreciation opportunities.

Convertible bonds are often traded in the secondary market, meaning investors can choose to buy or sell before maturity. However, the same is true for regular bonds. But depending on the issuer's credit rating and market conditions, the liquidity of these two types of bonds can vary significantly. For example, if a single company issues both types of bonds, depending on the company's circumstances, investors might have greater demand for one type of bond, thus leading to increased liquidity.

Finally, theoretically, convertible bonds can serve as a rebalancing tool for portfolio management. If investors realize they are overweight in debt instruments, they can choose to convert their bonds rather than selling them outright.

## Characteristics of Convertible Bonds

Here are some general characteristics of convertible bonds. While much information is scattered throughout this article, below is a comprehensive overview of features typically expected when dealing with convertible bonds:

- Conversion Option: Convertible bonds come with a conversion option, meaning bondholders can convert their bonds into a specified number of shares of the issuing company's stock.
- Interest Payments: As debt instruments, convertible bonds make periodic interest payments to bondholders. These interest rates may be lower than those of non-convertible bonds due to the added value of the conversion option.
- Maturity Date: Like traditional bonds, convertible bonds have a fixed maturity date when the debt issuer must repay the principal. If bondholders choose not to convert their bonds to stocks, they will receive the face value of the bond at maturity.
- Conversion Ratio: The conversion ratio of a convertible bond determines the number of shares the bondholder will receive upon conversion. This ratio is established at issuance and is typically expressed as the number of shares per bond. For example, a 20:1 conversion ratio means one bond can be converted into 20 shares of company stock.
- Conversion Price: The conversion price is the price at which the convertible bond can be converted into stock. It is typically set at issuance and is usually higher than the stock's market price at that time.
- Call and Put Options: Some convertible bonds include call and put options, adding flexibility for both issuers and bondholders. Call options allow issuers to force conversion or redemption before maturity, typically at a premium price. Put options allow bondholders to sell the bond back to the issuer at a specific price before maturity, providing an exit strategy for investors needing liquidity.

**Note:** Convertible bond arbitrage is a trading strategy aimed at profiting from pricing discrepancies between convertible bonds and their underlying stocks.

## Types of Convertible Bonds

Regular convertible bonds allow investors to choose between holding the bond until maturity or converting it into stocks. If the stock price falls after bond issuance, investors can choose to hold the bond until maturity and receive the face value; if the stock price rises significantly, investors can convert the bond into stocks and choose to either hold or sell the stocks based on their judgment. Ideally, investors want to convert bonds when the potential stock sale proceeds exceed the sum of the bond's face value and remaining interest.

Mandatory convertible bonds require investors to convert bonds at specific conversion ratios and price levels. On the other hand, reverse convertible bonds give the company the right to choose whether to convert the bonds into stocks or maintain them as fixed-income investments until maturity. If the bonds are converted, it is done at predetermined prices and conversion ratios.

## Calculating the Conversion Price of Convertible Bonds

Typically, the conversion price is set at a premium to the stock's market price at the time of issuance. This premium aims to incentivize investors to convert bonds into equity, ensuring they can acquire shares at a price below market value.

The calculation of the conversion price is relatively straightforward. It is calculated by dividing the bond's face value by the conversion ratio. The conversion ratio specifies the number of shares that bondholders will receive upon conversion. For example, if a convertible bond with a face value of $1,000 has a conversion ratio of 20, the conversion price would be $50 per share ($1,000 divided by 20). This means that for each bond held, the bondholder has the right to convert it into 20 shares of the company's stock at $50 per share.

In most cases, the conversion ratio of a convertible bond remains constant throughout the bond's life. When a convertible bond is issued, the conversion ratio is established and specified in the bond's terms. This ratio typically remains unchanged, so in the example above, investors can always exchange the bond for 20 shares, regardless of changes in the stock price.

However, the conversion ratio may be set unfavorably for conversion at the time the instrument is created. If the conversion price is set at or below market price, bondholders could immediately convert the bonds and sell the shares at a profit, effectively nullifying the value of the debt instrument. Therefore, in the example above, the actual market value of 20 shares might be $950, and investors might prefer to hold equity rather than debt, thus accepting a conversion price that is less favorable than the market price.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Convertible Bonds

Issuing convertible bonds can help companies mitigate negative investor sentiment associated with stock issuance. Each time a company issues additional shares or equity, it increases the number of outstanding shares, diluting existing investors' holdings. Companies may choose to issue convertible bonds to avoid negative sentiment. Bondholders can choose to convert their bonds to equity when the company performs well.

Issuing convertible bonds also provides investors with certain safety protection in case of default. Convertible bonds protect investors' principal from loss while allowing them to share in the company's success.

For example, a startup company might have a project requiring substantial capital, resulting in short-term losses. However, the project should make the company profitable in the future. Convertible bond investors can recover part of their principal if the company fails, while also participating in appreciation through bond conversion if the company succeeds.

Investors can benefit from the built-in appreciation component of convertible bonds, meaning they are essentially bonds with stock options, particularly call options. A call option is an agreement that gives the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase stocks, bonds, or other instruments at a specified price within a specified time. However, convertible bonds typically offer lower coupons or yields in exchange for the option to convert the bonds into common stock. This lower value is known as the bond floor.

Companies benefit from convertible bonds as they can issue debt at lower interest rates compared to traditional bond issuance. However, not all companies issue convertible bonds. Additionally, most convertible bonds are considered riskier and more volatile than typical fixed-income instruments.

#### Advantages

- Investors can receive fixed interest rate payments while having the option to convert to stocks to benefit from share price appreciation.
- Investors gain certain security protection against default risk, as bondholders receive payment before common shareholders.
- Companies can raise capital while avoiding immediate dilution of their shares.
- Companies may pay lower interest rates compared to using traditional bonds.

#### Disadvantages

- Due to their convertibility into common stock, convertible bonds typically offer lower coupon rates.
- For unprofitable issuing companies (such as startups), convertible bonds present additional risks to investors.
- If the bonds are converted to stocks, this may lead to equity dilution, which can suppress share prices and earnings per share dynamics.

## Convertible Bonds and Taxation

Regarding the taxation of convertible bonds, there are several points to note. Please be aware that if convertible bonds are held in tax-advantaged accounts, the following explanations may differ.

First, convertible bonds typically make periodic interest payments to bondholders. This interest income is usually taxed as ordinary income in the year it is received.

If a convertible bond is converted into the issuing company's stock and the investor subsequently sells the stock, any realized capital gains or losses may be subject to capital gains tax. The conversion of a convertible bond into stock is typically not a taxable event. However, any subsequent capital gains or losses realized from the sale of the stock are taxable.

Some convertible bonds may be issued at a price below par value, creating an Original Issue Discount (OID). OID is typically taxed as ordinary income over the life of the bond, regardless of whether the investor holds to maturity or sells early.

Finally, if a convertible bond is converted to stock and the issuing company pays dividends on the stock, these dividends may qualify for preferential tax treatment as qualified dividends. Qualified dividends typically apply at rates lower than ordinary income tax rates for eligible investors.

## Convertible Bond Example

For example, suppose ExxonMobil (XOM) issues a convertible bond with a face value of $1,000 that pays 4% interest. The bond has a 10-year maturity and a conversion ratio of 100 shares per convertible bond.

If the bond is held to maturity, investors will receive the $1,000 principal plus the annual interest payment of $40. However, if the company's stock price suddenly surges and trades at $11 per share, the value of 100 shares becomes $1,100 (100 shares × $11), exceeding the bond's value. Investors can convert the bond into stock and receive 100 shares, which can be sold in the market for a total of $1,100.

## How do Convertible Bonds Work?

Convertible bonds work by providing bondholders with the flexibility to convert their bonds into shares of the issuing company's stock. If bondholders choose to convert, they surrender their bonds and receive shares at a predetermined conversion price. If they choose not to convert, they continue to receive regular interest payments until the bond matures, at which point they receive the principal.

## What is the Conversion Ratio?

The conversion ratio of a convertible bond specifies the number of shares of stock that a bondholder will receive upon conversion. For example, a conversion ratio of 10:1 means that one convertible bond can be converted into 10 shares of the issuing company's stock.

## How does interest payment work for convertible bonds?

The interest payment mechanism for convertible bonds is similar to regular bonds. Bondholders receive periodic interest payments based on the bond's coupon rate and face value, typically semi-annually or annually. These payments continue until the bond matures or is converted into equity.

## What happens if convertible bonds are not converted?

If convertible bonds are not converted by bondholders before maturity, the issuing company typically has the obligation to repay the principal amount of the bonds plus any unpaid interest.

## When can bondholders convert their bonds into stocks?

Bondholders can typically convert their bonds into the issuing company's stock at any time before maturity, as long as they meet the conversion conditions specified in the bond terms. Sometimes companies may stipulate in the terms that the instrument can only be converted after being held or issued for a certain period (for example, not earlier than three months).

## Conclusion

Convertible bonds are hybrid securities that allow investors to convert their bonds into shares of the issuing company at a predetermined conversion price. They offer investors the potential for capital appreciation through equity participation while providing downside protection through fixed interest payments.
