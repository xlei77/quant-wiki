## What is Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)?

Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is the ideal number of units that a company should purchase to meet demand while minimizing inventory-related costs, such as holding costs, stockout costs, and ordering costs. This production scheduling model was introduced by Ford W. Harris in 1913 and has undergone several improvements. The EOQ formula assumes that demand, ordering costs, and holding costs remain constant.

### Key Points

- Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is the optimal order quantity for businesses that satisfies demand while minimizing total costs associated with ordering, receiving, and holding inventory.
- The EOQ formula works best when demand, ordering costs, and holding costs remain constant over time.
- A significant limitation of EOQ is that it assumes the demand for a company's products remains constant over time.

## Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Formula

The formula for Economic Order Quantity is:

## What Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Can Tell You

The EOQ formula aims to determine the optimal number of units to order for a product. When achieved, this helps companies reduce the costs of purchasing, shipping, and storing units. The EOQ formula can be modified to determine different production levels or order intervals, and large supply chain companies and businesses with high variable costs typically use algorithms in their computer software to determine EOQ.

EOQ is an important cash flow tool. The formula can help companies control the amount of cash tied up in inventory balances.

For many companies, inventory is the largest asset after human resources, and these businesses must maintain sufficient inventory to meet customer demand. If EOQ can help reduce inventory levels, the saved cash can be used for other business purposes or investments.

The EOQ formula determines a company's inventory reorder point. When inventory falls to a certain level, business processes using the EOQ formula trigger the need to order more units.

By determining the reorder point, businesses can avoid running out of inventory and continuously meet customer orders. If a company runs out of inventory, it incurs stockout costs, which is lost revenue due to the inability to complete orders because of insufficient inventory. Inventory shortages can also mean the company loses customers or receives reduced future orders.

## Example of How to Use Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

EOQ considers the timing of reordering, costs incurred from placing orders, and costs of storing goods. If a company continuously places small orders to maintain a specific inventory level, the ordering costs are higher, and additional storage space is required.

For example, consider a retail clothing store that sells men's jeans, with annual sales of 1,000 pairs. The company's annual holding cost per pair of jeans is $5, while the fixed cost per order is $2.

The EOQ formula is the square root of (2 x 1,000 pairs x $2 ordering cost)/($5 holding cost), which equals approximately 28.3. To minimize costs and meet customer demand, the ideal order quantity is slightly more than 28 pairs of jeans. The more complex components of the EOQ formula provide the reorder point.

## Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Limitations

The EOQ formula assumes that consumer demand is constant. The calculation also assumes that ordering and holding costs remain unchanged.

This fact makes it difficult or impossible for the formula to account for business events such as changes in consumer demand, seasonal variations in inventory costs, loss of sales revenue due to stock shortages, or bulk purchase discounts that companies might obtain.

## What is Economic Order Quantity?

Economic Order Quantity is an inventory management technique designed to help make efficient inventory management decisions. It refers to the optimal inventory level that a company should purchase to meet demand while minimizing holding and storage costs. An important limitation of Economic Order Quantity is that it assumes the demand for a company's products remains constant over time.

## When is Economic Order Quantity High or Low?

If a company's setup costs or product demand increases, the Economic Order Quantity will be higher; conversely, if the company's holding costs increase, the Economic Order Quantity will be lower.

## Why is Economic Order Quantity Important?

Economic Order Quantity is important because it helps companies manage inventory efficiently. Without inventory management techniques like this, businesses often hold excessive inventory during periods of low demand and insufficient inventory during periods of high demand. Both situations result in opportunity costs.

## Conclusion

Inventory management is a key component of business success. Excessive inventory leads to higher costs and erodes profits due to expenses associated with maintaining inventory and sometimes dealing with obsolete stock. Insufficient inventory means the company loses sales due to inability to meet demand. Economic Order Quantity helps ensure that businesses manage their inventory effectively.
