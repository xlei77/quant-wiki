## What is Stock Dilution?

Stock dilution refers to the decrease in existing shareholders' ownership percentage in a company due to the issuance of new shares. Dilution can also occur when stock option holders (such as company employees) or holders of other convertible securities exercise their options. When the number of outstanding shares increases, each existing shareholder's proportion of company ownership becomes smaller, i.e., diluted, resulting in a decrease in the value per share.

Stocks represent equity ownership in a company. When a company's board of directors decides to take their company public, typically through an Initial Public Offering (IPO), they authorize an initial number of shares to be issued. This number of outstanding shares is commonly referred to as the "float." If the company later issues additional shares (often called a secondary offering), they increase the float, thereby diluting their stock: shareholders who purchased shares in the original IPO now own a smaller percentage of the company than they did before the new shares were issued.

### Main Content

- Share dilution refers to the reduction in shareholders' equity due to the issuance or creation of new shares.
- Share dilution also reduces the company's earnings per share (EPS), which can negatively impact the stock price.
- Share dilution may occur when a company raises additional equity capital, although existing shareholders are typically at a disadvantage.

## Understanding Stock Dilution

Stock dilution, simply put, is like cutting the equity "cake" into more pieces. There will be more pieces, but each piece becomes smaller. Therefore, you still get your piece of the cake, but it represents a smaller proportion of the total than you expected, which is usually undesirable.

While it primarily affects equity ownership, stock dilution also reduces a company's Earnings Per Share (EPS, calculated as net profit divided by shares outstanding), which typically puts downward pressure on the stock price in the market. As a result, many public companies publish estimates of both undiluted and diluted earnings per share, which essentially provides investors with a "what-if scenario" in case new shares are issued. Diluted EPS assumes that potential dilutive securities have been converted into outstanding shares.

Stock dilution can occur when a company raises additional equity capital, as newly created shares are issued to new investors. The potential benefit of raising funds this way is that the money received from selling additional shares can improve the company's profitability and growth prospects, which in turn may increase the value of its stock.

Understandably, stock dilution is usually not viewed favorably by existing shareholders, and companies sometimes initiate stock buyback programs to help counter the effects of dilution. Note that stock splits do not cause dilution. In the case of a stock split, existing investors receive additional shares while the stock price is adjusted accordingly, maintaining their proportional ownership in the company unchanged.

## General Example of Stock Dilution

Suppose a company issues 100 shares of stock to 100 individual shareholders. Each shareholder owns 1% of the company. If the company subsequently conducts a secondary offering and issues 100 new shares to another 100 shareholders, then each shareholder only owns 0.5% of the company. The smaller ownership percentage also weakens each investor's voting power.

## Real Case Study of Stock Dilution

Typically, a public company announces its intention to issue new shares in advance, which will dilute its current equity pool. This allows both new and existing investors to plan accordingly. For example, MGT Capital filed a proxy statement on July 8, 2016, outlining the stock option plan for newly appointed CEO John McAfee. Additionally, the statement disclosed the structure of recent company acquisitions, which were purchased through a combination of cash and stock.

Both the executive stock option plan and acquisitions were expected to dilute the current number of outstanding shares. Furthermore, the proxy statement included a proposal for issuing new authorized shares, indicating that the company anticipated more equity dilution in the near term.

## Anti-dilution Protection

Shareholders typically resist equity dilution as it reduces the value of their existing equity stakes. Anti-dilution protection refers to contractual provisions that limit or completely prevent an investor's ownership stake in a company from being reduced in subsequent financing rounds. The anti-dilution protection mechanism is triggered when company actions would reduce the investor's percentage claim on company assets.

For example, if an investor holds a 20% stake and the company is about to conduct additional financing rounds, the company must offer discounted shares to the investor to at least partially compensate for the dilution of their overall ownership stake. Anti-dilution protection provisions commonly appear in venture capital financing agreements. Anti-dilution protection is sometimes referred to as "anti-dilution provisions."

Similarly, an anti-dilution clause is a provision in options or convertible securities, also known as "anti-dilution provisions." It protects investors from equity dilution resulting from subsequent stock issuances at prices lower than what the investor initially paid. These provisions are common in convertible preferred stock, which is a popular form of venture capital investment.
