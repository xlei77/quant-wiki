## What is Annual Return Rate?

Annual return rate refers to the return on investment over a specific period, typically expressed as a time-weighted annual percentage. Sources of returns can include dividends, capital returns, and capital appreciation. The annual return rate is measured relative to the initial investment amount and represents a geometric average rather than a simple arithmetic average.

### Key Points

- Annual return or annualized return is a metric that measures how much an investment increases on average each year over a specific period.
- Annualized return is calculated using geometric mean, showing the compound effect of yearly returns.
- Annual returns are more useful than simple returns when observing investment performance over time or comparing the performance of two investments.
- Annual returns can be applied to various assets, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, commodities, and certain derivatives.

## Understanding Annual Returns

Annual returns apply to various assets, including stocks, bonds, funds, commodities, and certain types of derivatives. It is the de facto standard method for comparing the performance of liquid investments. This method is considered more accurate because it takes into account the adjustment for compound interest. Different asset classes typically have different annual rates of return.

## Stock Annual Return Rate

The annual return rate, also known as the annualized return rate, represents the increase in stock value over a specific period. The required information for calculation includes the stock's current price and purchase price. If stock splits have occurred, the purchase price needs to be adjusted accordingly. After determining the prices, first calculate the simple return percentage, then annualize it.

The formula for simple return is the current price minus the purchase price, divided by the purchase price.

## Annual Return Calculation Example

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{CAGR} = \left ( \left ( \frac{ \text{结束值} }{ \text{开始值} } \right ) ^ \frac{ 1 }{ \text{年数} } \right ) - 1 \\ &\textbf{其中:} \\ &\text{CAGR} = \text{复合年增长率} \\ &\text{年数} = \text{持有期（年）} \\ \end{aligned} $$

Suppose an investor purchases a stock at $20 on January 1, 2024, and sells it at $35 on January 1, 2029, earning a profit of $15. During the five-year holding period, the investor also received $2 in total dividends. The investor's total return over five years was $17, equivalent to 85% (17/20) of the initial investment.

To achieve an 85% return over five years, the required annual return rate can be calculated using the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) formula:

$$ \begin{aligned} &\left ( \left ( \frac { 37 }{ 20 } \right ) ^ \frac{ 1 }{ 5 } \right ) - 1 = 13.1\% \text{ 年回报率} \\ \end{aligned} $$

Unlike typical averages, the annualized return rate accurately reflects investment gains or losses while also demonstrating the difficulty of recovering from losses. If an initial investment loses 50%, it requires a 100% gain in the following year to break even. Annualized return rates help balance investment outcomes for better comparison, as potential gains and losses can vary dramatically.

**Note:** Annual return rate statistics are commonly cited in marketing materials for mutual funds, ETFs, and other individual securities.

## Annual Return Rate for 401(k) Accounts

When calculating the annual return rate for a 401(k) account in a specific year, the methodology varies. First, the total return needs to be calculated. The initial value and final value for the observation period must be determined. Any account contributions made during this period must be subtracted from the final value before proceeding with subsequent calculations.

After determining the adjusted final value, divide it by the initial balance. Then subtract 1 from the result and multiply that number by 100 to calculate the percentage of total return.

## What is the Modified Dietz Formula?

The Modified Dietz Formula is a method for calculating annual returns that takes cash flows into account. It compounds returns within each period.

## Are there other methods to calculate annual returns?

You can calculate returns on a monthly basis and then multiply the result by 12 to obtain the annual return rate. There are many online calculators that can perform these calculations for you.

## How to Calculate Total Investment Return?

To calculate Return on Investment (ROI), subtract the initial cost from the final value of the investment, then divide the result by the total cost of investment, including fees, commissions, and markups. Multiply this result by 100 to get the percentage.

## Conclusion

The calculation of annual returns reflects your profit and loss on a specific investment. This metric is crucial for investors seeking growth in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, and can be used to compare the performance of liquid investments.

If you are unsure whether you have calculated the annual return correctly, it is recommended to consult with professionals to help plan your next investment decision.
