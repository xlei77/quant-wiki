## What is the CAPE Ratio (Shiller P/E)?

The CAPE ratio is a valuation metric that uses real earnings per share (EPS) over the past 10 years to smooth out the impact of profit fluctuations across different periods, adapting to changes in economic cycles.

CAPE ratio, which stands for Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings ratio, was popularized by Yale University professor Robert Shiller. It is also known as the Shiller P/E ratio. The P/E ratio is a valuation metric used to measure the relative relationship between stock price and a company's earnings per share. Earnings per share is calculated by dividing company profits by the number of outstanding shares.

The CAPE ratio is typically applied to broad stock indices to evaluate whether the market is undervalued or overvalued. Although it is a widely followed indicator, some industry experts have questioned its ability to predict future stock market returns.

### Key Points

- The CAPE ratio is used to analyze the long-term financial performance of listed companies while taking into account the impact of different economic cycles on company earnings.
- The CAPE ratio is similar to the P/E ratio and is primarily used to determine whether stocks are overvalued or undervalued.
- This ratio considers the impact of economic factors by comparing stock prices with the average earnings (adjusted for inflation) over the past 10 years.

## CAPE Ratio Formula

$$ CAPE \text{比率} = \frac{\text{股价}}{10 \text{年平均，} \text{通胀} - \text{调整后的收益}} $$

## What Can the CAPE Ratio Tell You?

A company's profitability is largely influenced by economic cycles. During periods of economic expansion, profits rise significantly and consumer spending increases; during recessions, consumer spending decreases, and profits plummet or may even turn into losses. Although cyclical industry companies (such as commodities and financials) experience significantly higher profit volatility than defensive industries (such as utilities and pharmaceuticals), in the face of deep recessions, only a few companies can maintain stable profitability.

The volatility in earnings per share also leads to significant fluctuations in the P/E ratio. Therefore, Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, in their 1934 classic "Security Analysis," suggested using a seven or ten-year average of earnings to analyze valuation ratios.[1]

## Real-World Examples of the CAPE Ratio

The CAPE ratio first gained attention in December 1996 when Robert Shiller and John Campbell presented research to the Federal Reserve, indicating that stock prices were rising far faster than earnings. In the winter of 1998, Shiller and Campbell published their groundbreaking paper "Valuation Ratios and the Long-Run Stock Market Outlook," which smoothed the S&P 500's earnings by using the average of real earnings over the previous 10 years dating back to 1872.[2]

The ratio reached a record high of 28 in January 1997, with similar high values occurring in 1989 and 2000. Shiller and Campbell claimed that the ratio predicted the market's true value would be 40% lower than its current level in 10 years. This prediction proved to be remarkably accurate, as the market crash of 2008 led to a 60% decline in the S&P 500 index from October 2007 to March 2009.

As the U.S. economic recovery accelerated in the second decade of this century, the S&P 500's CAPE ratio steadily increased, with stock prices reaching record levels. As of June 2024, the CAPE ratio stands at 35.49, significantly above its long-term average of 16.80.[3] Previously, readings above 30 had only occurred in 1929 and 2000, sparking intense debate about whether such high values in the ratio signal an impending major market correction.

## Limitations of the CAPE Ratio

Critics of the CAPE ratio argue that its utility is limited due to its inherently backward-looking nature. Another issue is that the ratio relies on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings, which have undergone significant changes in calculation methods in recent years.

In June 2016, Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School published a paper pointing out that using the CAPE ratio to predict future stock returns might be overly pessimistic due to changes in GAAP earnings calculation methods. [4] Siegel suggested that using consistent earnings data, such as operating earnings or National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) after-tax corporate profits, rather than GAAP earnings, could improve the CAPE model's predictive ability and indicate higher U.S. stock returns.

## What does CAPE stand for in the CAPE Ratio?

CAPE in the CAPE ratio stands for Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings ratio. This ratio is commonly known as the Shiller P/E ratio, named after Yale University professor Robert Shiller who popularized this indicator.

## What is CAPE Ratio Generally Used For?

The CAPE ratio is typically applied to broad stock indices to assess whether markets are undervalued or overvalued. However, critics argue that it's not very practical because it is inherently backward-looking and relies on GAAP earnings, which have undergone significant changes over time.

## When did the CAPE ratio first gain public attention?

The CAPE ratio first gained public attention in December 1996, when Robert Shiller and John Campbell presented research to the Federal Reserve, indicating that stock prices were rising faster than earnings. They published their article "Valuation Ratios and the Long-Run Stock Market Outlook" in winter 1998.

## Conclusion

The Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings ratio (CAPE) uses real earnings per share (EPS) over the past 10 years to smooth out corporate profit fluctuations across different economic cycles. This valuation metric analyzes listed companies' long-term financial performance while taking into account the impact of different economic cycles on company earnings.
