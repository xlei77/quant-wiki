## What is a Treasury Bond (T-Bond)?

Treasury Bonds (T-bonds) are government debt securities issued by the U.S. federal government with maturity periods of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds pay interest periodically before maturity, and at maturity, holders receive the face value equal to the principal.

T-bonds are an important component of U.S. sovereign debt, collectively known as Treasuries, and are generally considered nearly risk-free as they are backed by the U.S. government's taxing authority. [1]

### Key Points

- Treasury bonds (T-bonds) are fixed-rate U.S. government debt securities with maturities of 20 or 30 years.
- T-bonds pay interest semi-annually before maturity, and at maturity, the face value is paid to the bondholder.[1]
- Along with Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), T-bonds are one of four nearly risk-free government-issued securities.[2]

## Understanding Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)

Treasury Bonds (T-bonds) are one of four debt instruments issued by the U.S. Treasury Department to finance U.S. government spending activities. These four debt instruments are Treasury Bills, Treasury Notes, Treasury Bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). These securities differ in their maturity and interest payment structures.

They are considered benchmarks for comparable fixed-income categories because they are virtually risk-free. T-bonds are backed by the U.S. government, which can ensure full payment through increased taxation and revenue. [2]

These investments are also viewed as benchmarks in their respective fixed-income categories as they provide a base interest rate founded on low-risk investment. T-bonds have longer terms and are issued with maturities of 20 and 30 years. [1]

Similar to other government bonds, T-bonds pay interest semi-annually, and the yields are only taxed at the federal level. T-bonds are issued through online monthly auctions conducted directly by the U.S. Treasury. The bond prices and yields are determined at auction, after which T-bonds actively trade in the secondary market and can be purchased through banks or brokers.

Individual investors often use T-bonds to keep a portion of their retirement savings risk-free, provide stable retirement income, or save for children's education or other major expenses. Investors must hold T-bonds for at least 45 days before they can sell them in the secondary market. [1]

## Treasury Bond Considerations

Treasury bonds are issued with maturities of 20 or 30 years, with a minimum denomination of $100, and interest payments are made semi-annually. The bonds are initially sold through auction; purchases are limited to $5 million for non-competitive bids (or 35% of the issue amount for competitive bids). [3]

Competitive bidders specify the interest rate they are willing to accept; acceptance is based on comparison with the bond's set rate. Non-competitive bidders are guaranteed to receive bonds but must accept the set rate. After the auction, bonds can be sold in the secondary market. [4]

Treasury bonds are actively traded in the secondary market, which provides high liquidity for investments. Additionally, the secondary market causes significant price fluctuations in the trading market. Therefore, current auction rates and yields of Treasury bonds determine their pricing levels in the secondary market.

Similar to other types of bonds, when auction rates rise, T-bond prices fall in the secondary market because future cash flows are discounted at higher rates. Conversely, when prices rise, auction rate yields decline. [4]

In the fixed income market, Treasury yields help form the yield curve, which encompasses the full range of investments offered by the U.S. government. The yield curve shows yields plotted against maturity and typically slopes upward (shorter-term rates are lower than longer-term rates). However, the yield curve can become inverted when long-term rates fall below short-term rates. A yield curve inversion may signal an impending economic recession. [5]

## What are the types of Treasury securities?

There are three main types of U.S. Treasury securities: Bonds, Notes, and Bills. Treasury Bills have maturities of less than one year, Notes have maturities of 2 to 5 years, and Bonds have maturities of 20 or 30 years. All of these are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.[2]

## Are Treasury Bonds a Good Investment?

Whether treasury bonds are a good investment depends on the specific investor. Treasury bonds are considered risk-free assets and are suitable for investors with lower risk tolerance; however, due to their safety, treasury bonds offer lower interest rates, which limits returns. During stock market downturns, these may be good options for some investors. Furthermore, although treasury bonds are risk-free, they are susceptible to inflation risk and interest rate risk, which may reduce investor returns. [1]

## Conclusion

Treasury bonds are part of U.S. government securities. They are low-risk assets suitable for investors seeking safe but lower-yield investments. Investors can invest in Treasury bonds through Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. The UK equivalent, known as gilts, are also traded through government bond funds.

Treasury bonds are also a good choice for investors seeking refuge from volatile stock markets. Since Treasury bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which has the world's largest and most stable economy, they are considered risk-free investments. [1]
