## Understanding Prime Brokerage Business

The core of prime brokerage services lies in facilitating complex and active trading operations for large financial institutions (such as hedge funds). Prime brokers allow hedge funds to borrow securities and increase leverage, while acting as intermediaries between hedge funds and counterparties such as pension funds and commercial banks.

Prime brokerage firms (sometimes called prime brokers) are typically large financial institutions that deal with other major institutions and hedge funds. Most large banks have prime brokerage divisions that serve hundreds of clients. Although prime brokerage firms offer multiple services, clients are not required to participate in all services and can choose other institutions to provide services based on their needs.

## Prime Brokerage Services

Prime brokerage services provide a range of services to eligible clients. Designated brokers may offer clearing and settlement services as well as leveraged financing services, provide asset custody services, and prepare daily account statements.

The information and resources provided by prime brokers are something many institutions may not be able to possess internally. In essence, prime brokerage services provide large institutions with a mechanism to outsource many investment activities, allowing them to focus on investment objectives and strategies.

Additionally, prime brokerage firms may offer concierge-style services. These services can include risk management, capital introduction, securities financing, and cash financing. Some firms even offer office space sublease opportunities and other facility-based benefits. As with traditional services, participation in any concierge services is optional.

In the case of securities lending, prime brokers typically require collateral. This enables them to reduce risk while maintaining quick access to funds when needed.

## Prime Brokerage Account Requirements

Most prime brokerage clients are large investors and institutions. Fund managers and hedge funds typically qualify, along with arbitrageurs and various other professional investors. In the case of hedge funds, prime brokerage services are generally considered crucial to the fund's success.

Two common types of clients are pension funds (a form of institutional investor) and commercial banks. These investors typically handle large amounts of investment cash but lack internal resources to manage investments independently.

The minimum account size to open a prime brokerage account is $500,000 in equity, though such an account may not receive services beyond what discount brokers offer.

**Note:** Some of the largest prime brokers in the United States are investment banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup.

For hedge funds or other institutional clients, to receive "worthwhile prime brokerage account" services (especially reduced trading fees), account sizes typically need to reach $50 million in equity.

Nevertheless, these services remain highly sought after by clients, and premier banks only accept clients who can bring benefits over the long term. Consequently, hedge funds seeking the best treatment may need to have up to $200 million in equity.

## Prime Brokerage Business Example

Hedge fund ABC has just launched with a $75 million investment from investors. This is a small hedge fund employing 15 staff members. Most of these employees are traders, researchers, and a few administrative personnel. The fund has limited resources available to meet various business needs.

To alleviate some of the burden, ABC trades with JPMorgan's prime brokerage division. Both parties have signed a prime brokerage agreement that details JPMorgan's responsibilities in managing ABC's cash management, calculating its monthly Net Asset Value (NAV), and conducting risk management analysis of its portfolio. For providing these services, both parties agreed that JPMorgan would charge a monthly fee of $20,000.

Six months later, ABC has grown and its investment strategies have become more complex. It needs to borrow securities as part of its investment strategy and trades with JPMorgan for securities lending services. For this, JPMorgan charges 5% of the borrowed amount. ABC also engages in capital introduction services with JPMorgan, where JPMorgan introduces ABC to potential investors and charges a 2% fee on the investment amount from each investor.

All these services provided by JPMorgan to hedge fund ABC constitute prime brokerage services.
