## What is an Initial Public Offering (IPO)?

An Initial Public Offering (IPO) refers to when a private company issues stocks to the public for the first time. IPOs allow companies to raise equity capital from public investors.

The transition from a private company to a public company can be a significant moment for private investors to fully realize their investment returns, as it typically includes a premium on the stock for current private investors. At the same time, it also allows public investors to participate in the offering.

### Key Points

- Initial Public Offering (IPO) refers to the process of offering shares of a private company to the public through the issuance of new stock.
- Companies must meet the requirements of both the stock exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to conduct an IPO.
- IPOs provide companies with an opportunity to raise capital by issuing stocks through the primary market.
- Companies hire investment banks to handle marketing, gauge demand, set IPO prices and dates, and other related tasks.
- IPOs can be viewed as an exit strategy for company founders and early investors to realize the full value of their private investments.

## How Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) Work

Before an IPO, a company is considered private. As a pre-IPO private company, the business has grown with a relatively small number of shareholders, including founders, family and friends as early investors, and professional investors such as venture capitalists or angel investors.

An IPO is a major step for a company as it provides access to raising significant amounts of capital. This enables the company to grow and expand more effectively. The increased transparency and credibility of being publicly listed also helps the company secure better terms when seeking loans.

When a company reaches a stage in its growth where it believes it is mature enough to handle the strict SEC regulations and the responsibilities and obligations to public shareholders, it begins to advertise its intention to go public.

Typically, this growth stage occurs when a company reaches a private valuation of approximately $1 billion, known as unicorn status. However, private companies of various valuations with strong fundamentals and proven profit potential can qualify for an IPO depending on market competition and their ability to meet listing requirements.

A company's IPO shares are priced through underwriting due diligence. When a company goes public, previously held private share ownership converts to public ownership, and the value of existing private shares becomes equal to the public trading price. Stock underwriting can also include special provisions for private to public share ownership.

**Important Note:** Generally, the transition from private to public represents a critical moment for private investors to cash in and receive their expected returns. Private shareholders may either hold onto their shares in the public market or sell some or all of their shares for gains.

Meanwhile, the public market provides tremendous opportunity for millions of investors to buy company shares and contribute to the company's shareholders' equity. The public includes any individual or institutional investors interested in investing in the company.

Overall, the number of shares the company sells and the price of the shares are the generating factors for the company's new shareholders' equity value. Shareholders' equity continues to represent ownership of shares by investors, whether private or public, but through an IPO, shareholders' equity significantly increases with the cash brought in from primary issuance.

## History of IPOs

The term "Initial Public Offering (IPO)" has been a buzzword on Wall Street and among investors for decades. The Dutch are credited with conducting the first modern IPO, offering shares of the Dutch East India Company to the public.

Since then, IPOs have been used as a way for companies to raise capital from public investors through the issuance of public share ownership.

Over the years, IPOs have been characterized by rising and falling trends in issuance volume. Individual industries have also experienced ups and downs in issuance due to innovation and various other economic factors. During the height of the internet bubble, tech IPOs multiplied as startups without revenue rushed to go public on the stock market.

The 2008 financial crisis led to the year with the fewest IPOs. Following the economic recession after the 2008 financial crisis, IPOs stagnated, with few new public companies in the years that followed. Recently, much of the IPO excitement has shifted to focus on so-called unicorns - startups valued at over $1 billion. Investors and media extensively speculate about these companies and their decisions to either go public through IPOs or remain private.

## What is the IPO Process?

The IPO process primarily consists of two parts. The first part is the pre-marketing phase of the issuance, and the second part is the initial public offering itself. When a company is interested in an IPO, it advertises to underwriters through private bid solicitations, or it may also make a public announcement to generate interest.

The underwriter leads the IPO process and is selected by the company. A company can choose one or multiple underwriters to jointly manage different aspects of the IPO process. Underwriters are involved in various aspects of the IPO, including due diligence, document preparation, filing, marketing, and issuance.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of IPO

The primary goal of an IPO is to raise capital for the company. It can also bring other advantages and disadvantages.

One key advantage is that companies can raise funds from the entire investing public. This facilitates easier acquisition deals (share exchanges) and increases the company's exposure, prestige, and public image, which can help with sales and profits.

The increased transparency required through quarterly reporting typically helps companies secure more favorable credit borrowing terms compared to private companies.

Companies may face several disadvantages of going public and might opt for alternative strategies. Some major disadvantages include the high costs of IPOs and the ongoing costs of maintaining a public company, which are usually unrelated to other business expenses.

Stock price fluctuations can distract management, who may be compensated and evaluated based on stock performance rather than actual financial results. Additionally, companies must disclose financial, accounting, tax, and other business information. In these disclosure processes, they may have to reveal secrets and business methods that could help competitors.

Rigid board leadership and governance can make it harder for companies to retain good managers who are willing to take risks. Staying private remains an option. Instead of going public, companies can solicit acquisition offers. Furthermore, companies can explore various alternatives.

#### Advantages

- Can raise additional funds through secondary offerings in the future
- Attract and retain better management and skilled employees through liquid stock equity participation (e.g., ESOP)
- IPO can reduce the company's cost of equity and debt capital

#### Disadvantages

- Generates substantial legal, accounting, and marketing costs, many of which are ongoing
- Management needs to invest more time, energy, and attention to complete reports
- Loss of control, agency problems become more severe

## IPO Alternatives

Direct listing refers to an IPO conducted without any underwriters. Direct listing skips the underwriting process, which means the issuer bears greater risk if the issuance performs poorly, but the issuer may also benefit from higher stock prices. Direct listings are typically only suitable for companies with well-known brands and attractive businesses.

In a Dutch auction, no IPO price is set. Potential buyers can bid on the shares they want and the price they're willing to pay. Then, bidders willing to pay the highest prices will receive the available shares.

## Investing in IPOs

When a company decides to raise capital through an IPO, this special exit strategy can only maximize returns for early investors and raise the most capital for the enterprise after careful consideration and analysis. Therefore, when the IPO decision is made, the prospects for future growth may be high, and many public investors will line up to acquire shares for the first time. IPOs are typically discounted to ensure sales, making them more attractive, especially when they generate substantial buyers from primary issuance.

Initially, IPO prices are typically set by underwriters through their pre-marketing process. Essentially, IPO pricing is based on company valuations using fundamental techniques. The most commonly used technique is discounted cash flow, which is the net present value of the company's expected future cash flows.

Underwriters and interested investors look at this value on a per-share basis. Other methods available for setting prices include equity value, enterprise value, comparable company adjustments, etc. While underwriters do consider demand, they typically also lower prices to ensure success on IPO day.

Analyzing the fundamentals and technicals of an IPO issue can be very difficult. Investors will follow news headlines, but the primary source of information should be the prospectus, which becomes available after the company files its S-1 registration statement.[3] The prospectus provides extensive useful information. Investors should pay particular attention to the management team and their comments, as well as the quality of the underwriters and specific details of the deal. Successful IPOs are typically backed by large investment banks that are good at promoting new issues.

Overall, the IPO journey is very long. Therefore, interested public investors can follow news headlines and other information that develops along the way to help supplement their assessment of optimal and potential issue prices.

The pre-marketing process typically includes demand from large private qualified investors and institutional investors, which heavily influences how the IPO trades on its first day of trading. Public investors don't participate until the final issue date. All investors can participate, but individual investors must have trading privileges. The most common way for individual investors to obtain shares is to open an account with a brokerage platform that has itself received an allocation and wishes to share with clients.

## IPO Performance

Several factors can influence IPO returns, which investors typically monitor closely. Some IPOs may be overhyped by investment banks, potentially leading to initial losses. However, most IPOs are known for short-term trading gains as they are introduced to the public. There are several key considerations in IPO performance.

If you look at charts following many IPOs, you'll notice significant stock drops several months later. This is typically due to the expiration of lock-up periods. When a company goes public, underwriters require company insiders (such as officers and employees) to sign lock-up agreements.

A lock-up agreement is a legally binding contract between underwriters and company insiders that prohibits them from selling any shares for a specific period. This period can range from 3 to 24 months. Under Rule 144 (SEC law), the minimum period is 90 days, but the lock-up period specified by underwriters may last longer.[4] The issue is that when the lock-up period expires, all insiders can sell their shares. The result is people rushing to sell their stocks to realize their profits. This excess supply can create serious downward pressure on the stock price.

Some investment banks include waiting periods in their offering terms. This reserves some shares for purchase after a specific period. If the underwriter purchases this allocation, the price may rise; if not purchased, the price may fall.

Flipping refers to the practice of reselling IPO shares within the first few days to earn quick profits. This is common when stocks are discounted and soar on their first trading day.

Closely related to traditional IPOs is when an existing company spins off part of its business as a separate entity, creating tracking stocks. The rationale behind spin-offs and creating tracking stocks is that, in some cases, company divisions may be more valuable separately than as a whole. For example, if a division has high growth potential but exists within a slow-growth company with significant current losses, it might be worthwhile to spin it off while keeping the parent company as a major shareholder and then let it raise more capital through an IPO.

From an investor's perspective, these can be interesting IPO opportunities. Generally, spin-offs from existing companies provide investors with substantial information about the parent company and its stake in the spun-off company. The more information available to potential investors is usually better, so savvy investors might find good opportunities in this type of scenario. Due to greater investor understanding, spin-offs typically experience less initial volatility.

**Important Note:** IPOs are known for volatile returns on their first trading day, which may attract investors hoping to profit from the discounts involved. In the long term, IPO prices will stabilize at a steady value that can be tracked using traditional stock price indicators like moving averages. Investors who like IPO opportunities but may not want to take on individual stock risk might be interested in managed funds that focus on the IPO space. But also be wary of so-called "hot IPOs," which might just be hype.

## What is the Purpose of an Initial Public Offering?

An IPO is essentially a fundraising method used by large companies, where the company sells its shares to the public for the first time. After the IPO, the company's shares are traded on stock exchanges. Some of the main motivations for conducting an IPO include: raising capital through the sale of shares, providing liquidity for company founders and early investors, and capitalizing on higher valuations.

## Can Anyone Invest in an IPO?

Typically, demand for new IPOs exceeds supply. Therefore, there is no guarantee that all investors interested in an IPO will be able to purchase shares. Those interested in participating in an IPO can do so through their brokerage firms, although access to IPOs may sometimes be limited to the firm's larger clients. Another option is to invest through mutual funds or other investment vehicles that focus on IPOs.

## Is an IPO a Good Investment?

IPOs often attract widespread media attention, some of which is deliberately cultivated by companies during their public listing. Generally, IPOs are popular among investors because they tend to generate dramatic price movements on the IPO day and shortly thereafter. This occasionally produces substantial gains, although it can also result in significant losses. Ultimately, investors should evaluate each IPO based on the company's prospectus, as well as their own financial situation and risk tolerance.

## How is IPO Pricing Determined?

When a company conducts an IPO, it needs to establish an initial value for its new shares. This is done by the underwriting banks that will market the deal. To a large extent, a company's value is determined by its fundamentals and growth prospects. Since IPOs may come from relatively new companies, they might not yet have a proven track record of profitability. Instead, comparable companies can be used. However, the supply and demand dynamics for IPO shares also come into play in the days leading up to the IPO.
