## What is the Knowledge Economy?

The knowledge economy is a consumption and production system based on intellectual capital. Specifically, it refers to the ability to utilize scientific discoveries and applied research.

In most highly developed economies, the knowledge economy accounts for a significant portion of activities. In a knowledge economy, important components of value may include intangible assets, such as the value of workers' knowledge or intellectual property.

### Key Points

- Knowledge economy describes the commercialization of contemporary scientific and academic research.
- In the knowledge economy, research-based innovations are commodified through patents and other forms of intellectual property.
- The knowledge economy sits at the intersection of private entrepreneurship, academia, and government-funded research.
- Knowledge-related industries account for a significant portion of activity in most highly developed countries.
- The knowledge economy relies on skilled labor and education, robust communication networks, and institutional structures that incentivize innovation.

## Understanding the Knowledge Economy

Developing economies often focus heavily on agriculture and manufacturing, while highly developed countries have a larger proportion of service-related activities. This includes knowledge-based economic activities such as research, technical support, and consulting.

The knowledge economy is the market for production and sale of scientific and engineering discoveries. This knowledge can be commoditized in the form of patents or other intellectual property protections. The producers of such information, such as scientific experts and research laboratories, are also considered part of the knowledge economy.

**Important Note:** The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 was a significant turning point in U.S. intellectual property treatment, as it allowed universities to retain ownership of inventions or discoveries made using federal R&D funds and negotiate exclusive licenses.[1]

Due to globalization, the world economy has become more knowledge-based, bringing best practices to each country's economy. Furthermore, knowledge-based factors have created an interconnected global economy where human expertise and trade secrets are considered important economic resources.

However, it's important to note that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) do not allow companies to include these assets on their balance sheets.

**Note:** The modern commercialization of academic research and basic science originated from governments seeking military advantages.

## Knowledge Economy and Human Capital

Knowledge economy explores how education and knowledge (i.e., "human capital") can be sold and exported as a productive asset or commercial product, thereby generating profits for individuals, businesses, and economies.

This component of the economy primarily relies on intellectual capabilities rather than natural resources or physical contributions. In a knowledge economy, products and services based on intellectual expertise drive developments in technology and science, thereby promoting innovation across the entire economy.

The World Bank defines the knowledge economy based on four pillars:

## Examples of the Knowledge Economy

Academic institutions, companies engaged in research and development (R&D), programmers developing new software and search engines for data, and healthcare workers using digital data to improve treatments are all components of the knowledge economy.

These economic agents transfer their research findings to workers in more traditional sectors, such as farmers who use software applications and digital solutions to better manage their crops, medical procedures based on advanced technologies (like robot-assisted surgery), or schools that provide digital learning aids and online courses for students.

## How Big is the Knowledge Economy?

Due to it not being a clearly defined category like manufacturing, it's difficult to put an exact price tag on the global knowledge economy. However, a rough estimate can be obtained by measuring some of the main components of the knowledge economy. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in the United States, the total value of the intellectual property market is $6.6 trillion, with IP-intensive industries accounting for more than one-third of GDP. The market size of higher education institutions in the country accounts for an additional $568 billion.[3]4

## What are the Most Valuable Skills in the Knowledge Economy?

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) believes that while higher education and technical training are obvious assets, communication and teamwork are also fundamental skills in the knowledge economy. Since any individual knowledge worker is unlikely to produce breakthrough innovations alone, these interpersonal and workplace capabilities are crucial for survival in knowledge-based workplaces.[5]

## Which Country Has the Largest Knowledge Economy?

The factors of knowledge economy are measured by the United Nations Development Programme's Global Knowledge Index, which replaced the World Bank's Knowledge Economy Index after 2012. This indicator scores each country/region based on "enabling factors" of the knowledge economy, such as education levels, technical and vocational training, innovation, and communication technology. According to the latest edition, Switzerland ranks as the highest knowledge economy with a total score of 71.5%. It is followed closely by Sweden and the United States, both scoring 70.0.[6]
