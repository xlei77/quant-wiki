## What is Par Value?

Par value is a financial term used to describe the nominal or dollar value of a security, typically specified by the issuer. For bonds, par value is the amount paid to the holder at maturity. The par value of bonds is commonly referred to as "face value" or simply "par value."

For stocks, par value is the original cost indicated on the certificate. In practice, the par value of stocks is not significant. In countries like the United States, par value can be set to a low and arbitrary amount. Many U.S. companies intentionally issue stocks with extremely low par values due to specific state regulations. These rules link company registration fees to the par value of registered shares. By setting a low par value for their stocks, companies can reduce their registration fees.

Next, let's review other important information about face value or par value.

### Key Points

- Par value describes the nominal or dollar value of a security, as specified by the issuer.
- The par value of a stock is its initial cost as listed on the certificate.
- The par value of a bond is the dollar amount to be paid to investors at maturity.
- The actual market value of stocks or bonds does not reliably reflect their par value, as many other factors such as supply and demand are at play.

## Understanding Par Value

In bond investments, par value (face value) is the amount that bondholders receive at maturity, provided the bond issuer does not default. However, bonds traded in the secondary market fluctuate with interest rate changes. For example, if interest rates are higher than the bond's coupon rate, the bond sells at a discount (below par value).

Conversely, if interest rates are lower than the bond's coupon rate, the bond sells at a premium (above par value). While a bond's par value provides a guaranteed return, the par value of stocks does not indicate their actual value.

## Par Value and Bonds

The par value of a bond is the amount that the issuer pays to the bondholder at maturity. Bonds can have additional coupon rates, or the return may be based solely on the appreciation from the original issue price below par to the par value at maturity.

**Important Note:** Although a bond's par value is typically fixed, there is a notable exception with inflation-linked bonds, where the par value adjusts based on the inflation rate over a predetermined period.

## Par Value and Stocks

The total par value of all shares in a company establishes the legal capital that the company must maintain. Only the portion exceeding the legal capital can be returned to investors through dividends. In essence, the funds covering the par value act as a default reserve.

However, companies are not required to specify a par value at issuance. This allows companies to flexibly use very low values to determine the size of their reserves. For example, AT&T Inc. (T) has a par value of $1 per common share, while Apple Inc. (AAPL) has a par value of $0.00001 per share.

|Different Types of Value in Finance
|---|---|
|Value Type|Stocks|Bonds
|Book Value|The value of a company's assets minus liabilities. Reflects the theoretical value of remaining shares if the company liquidates.|Not applicable to bonds.
|Par Value/Face Value/Nominal Value|The stated value of shares, usually of little relevance in modern markets. Historically, it represented the initial price of the stock.|The amount the bond issuer promises to repay to bondholders at maturity.
|Intrinsic Value|An estimate of a stock's true value based on company fundamentals (such as earnings, assets, and growth potential).|The present value of future bond cash flows (coupons and principal), discounted at a rate reflecting bond risk and interest rates.
|Market Value|The current trading price of the stock on the securities exchange.|The price at which the bond is trading. This fluctuates based on interest rates, credit risk, and market conditions.
|Net Asset Value (NAV)|The value of total assets minus liabilities, commonly used for mutual funds and ETFs. Represents the per-share value of fund holdings.|Not applicable to individual bonds, but relevant for bond funds.
|Premium/Discount Value|Not directly applicable to stocks, but refers to stocks trading above (premium) or below (discount) their intrinsic value.|Refers to bonds trading above (premium) or below (discount) their par value.
|Present Value|The value of future cash flows (stock dividends) discounted at a rate reflecting risk and time value of money.|The present value of future bond cash flows (coupons and principal), discounted at a rate reflecting bond risk and current market rates.
|Principal Value|Not applicable to stocks.|The amount initially invested in the bond or the amount Outstanding at a specific time.

## Par Value and Market Value

The par value of stocks or bonds is not equal to their actual market value. Market value is determined by the principles of supply and demand, reflecting the dollar amount investors are willing to buy or sell the security for at a particular time. Depending on market conditions, par value and market value may have little correlation.

In the bond market, interest rates (compared to the bond's coupon rate) may determine whether bonds sell at prices above or below par value. Zero-coupon bonds, or those where investors have no income other than purchasing bonds below par value, typically only sell at prices below par value, as this is the only viable way for investors to make a profit.

## Are Par Value and Face Value the Same?

Yes. Par value refers to the dollar value of a financial instrument at issuance. For bonds, the par value is the price that the issuer pays at maturity, also known as "face value." In contrast, for stocks, the par value is the price set by the issuer when the stock is first issued.

## What is the difference between par value and market value?

While par value is the original price of a stock set by its issuer, market value is influenced by supply and demand. Market value is the price allowed by the market, which can differ significantly from the stock's initial price. For example, Apple's stock has a par value of $0.00001, while its market value at closing on June 10, 2024, was $193.12 per share.

## What is the difference between par value and bond price?

The par value of a bond is fixed, typically issued in units of $1,000. In contrast, its price fluctuates based on market interest rates, time to maturity, and the issuer's credit rating. Depending on these conditions, the bond price may be higher or lower than its par value. For example, if interest rates rise, bond prices will fall and trade at prices below par value in the secondary market.

## What is Book Value?

Book value is the net value of a company's assets recorded on its balance sheet. It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets. Essentially, book value reflects the amount that would remain for shareholders if the company were to liquidate all assets and pay off all debts. This metric provides insight into a company's intrinsic value, and investors often use it to evaluate whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued.

## Summary

In finance, par value refers to the nominal or dollar value of a security as declared by the issuer, commonly known as "face value," primarily associated with bonds. Par value differs from market value, which is the price of a security determined by supply and demand relationships. For bonds, par value refers to the amount paid to bondholders at maturity. However, like stocks, bond market prices can fluctuate if sold in the secondary market.

Historically, par value ensured that companies would not sell stocks below a certain price. In times of limited information, par value also protected shareholders. For issuers, par value created value expectations when selling shares.
