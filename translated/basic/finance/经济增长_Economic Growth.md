## What is Economic Growth?

Economic growth refers to the increase in the production of economic goods and services during a period compared to the previous period. It can be measured in nominal or real terms. Traditionally, overall economic growth is measured by Gross National Product (GNP) or Gross Domestic Product (GDP), although alternative indicators are sometimes used.

### Key Points Summary

- Economic growth refers to the increase in the production of goods and services within an economy.
- Increases in capital goods, labor force, technology, and human capital all contribute to economic growth.
- Tax cuts are generally less effective at stimulating economic growth compared to increased government spending.
- Economic growth is typically measured by the increase in the total market value of additional goods and services produced, using estimates such as GDP.

## Understanding Economic Growth

In simple terms, economic growth refers to the increase in total output within an economy, typically manifested as growth in national income.

Generally (but not always), growth in total output is associated with improvements in average marginal productivity. This leads to increased income, encouraging consumers to open their wallets to purchase more goods, and drives higher material quality of life and living standards.

In economics, growth is typically modeled as a function of physical capital, human capital, labor, and technology. Increasing the quantity or quality of working-age population, the tools they can use, and the recipes they can employ to combine labor, capital, and raw materials will result in increased economic output.

## Stages of Economic Growth

Economic activity goes through different periods. This movement is known as the "business cycle." It consists of four stages:

- Expansion: During this stage, employment, income, industrial production, and sales all increase, and real GDP is also rising.
- Peak: This is when economic expansion reaches its highest point. It is essentially a turning point.
- Contraction: During this stage, all elements of expansion begin to decrease. When a significant decline in economic activity spreads throughout the economy, it becomes a recession.
- Trough: This is when economic contraction reaches its lowest point.

A complete business cycle is measured from peak to peak or from trough to trough. These cycles typically have irregular lengths, and contractions may occur during expansion periods, and vice versa.

Since World War II, the U.S. economy has experienced more periods of expansion than contraction. Between 1945 and 2019, the average expansion period lasted approximately 65 months, while the average contraction period lasted only 11 months. However, the Great Recession from December 2007 to June 2009 lasted 18 months. This was followed by the longest expansion on record, lasting 128 months, until the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020.[1]

**Note:** Governments typically try to stimulate economic growth by lowering interest rates, making borrowing costs cheaper. However, this can only continue for so long. Eventually, as happened in 2022 and 2023, interest rates need to be raised to combat price increases and prevent the economy from overheating.[2]

## How to Measure Economic Growth

The most commonly used indicator for measuring economic growth is real GDP. This is the total value of all goods and services produced within an economy, adjusted to eliminate the effects of inflation. There are three different ways to look at real GDP.

- Quarterly Growth Rate (Annualized): This examines the change in GDP from one quarter to another and then compounds it into an annualized rate. For example, if the change in one quarter is 0.3%, the annualized rate would be inferred as 1.2%.
- Four-Quarter or Year-over-Year Growth Rate: This compares GDP in a single quarter with the same quarter in consecutive years, expressed as a percentage. Businesses often use this to offset the effects of seasonal variations.
- Annual Average Growth Rate: This is the average of quarterly changes. For example, if growth rates for four quarters in a year are 2%, 3%, 1.5%, and 1%, then the annual average growth rate would be 7.5% รท 4 = 1.875%.

**Note:** GDP is the most popular way to measure economic growth, calculated by adding up all spending by consumers, businesses, and government during a given period. The formula is: GDP = Consumer Spending + Business Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports.

Of course, measuring the value of goods is tricky. Some goods and services are considered more valuable than others. For example, a smartphone is more valuable than a pair of socks. Growth must be measured in terms of the value of goods and services, not just quantity.

Another issue is that not everyone assigns the same value to the same goods and services. A heater is more valuable to residents of Alaska, while air conditioning is more valuable to residents of Florida. Some people consider steak more valuable than fish, and vice versa.

A common approximation is current market value. In the United States, this is measured in dollars and summed to produce an overall measure of output, including GDP.

**Important:** There are alternatives to GDP. For example, the World Bank uses GNI (Gross National Income) per capita (which includes income remitted by overseas citizens) to measure economic growth, analyze country classifications, and determine lending eligibility. [3]

## How to Generate Economic Growth

Economic growth depends on the following four contributing areas:

First is the increase in the quantity of physical capital goods in the economy. Adding capital to the economy tends to increase labor productivity. Newer, better, and more tools mean workers can produce more output in each time period.

Take a simple example: a fisherman with a fishing net catches more fish per hour than one with just a fishing rod. However, there are two key points to this process.

Someone in the economy must first engage in some form of saving to free up resources for creating new capital. Additionally, the new capital must be of the right type, in the right place, and activated at the right time for workers to actually use it productively.

The second way to generate economic growth is through technological improvements. The invention of gasoline fuel is an example. Before its energy-generating capacity was discovered, oil had relatively low economic value. This changed when gasoline use proved to be a more effective method of transporting goods.

Improved technology enables workers to produce more output with the same stock of capital goods by combining them in more effective ways. Like capital growth, the rate of technological growth is highly dependent on savings and investment rates, as these are necessary for engaging in R&D.

**Note:** The four factors of production are land and natural resources, labor, capital equipment, and entrepreneurship.

Another way to generate economic growth is by increasing the labor force. All else being equal, more workers produce more economic goods and services.

In the 19th century, America's strong economic growth was partly attributed to the influx of large amounts of cheap, efficient immigrant labor. However, like capital-driven growth, this process also has some key conditions.[4]

Increasing the labor force necessarily increases the amount of output that must be consumed to provide for new workers' basic survival, so new workers need to be at least productive enough to offset this rather than being net consumers.

Furthermore, just like adding capital, it's important that the right type of workers flow to the right jobs, in the right places, and combine with the right type of complementary capital goods to realize their productive potential.

The final method is to increase human capital. This means workers become more skilled at their craft, improving their productivity through skill training, trial and error, or simply more practice. Savings, investment, and specialization are the most consistent and controllable methods.

In this context, human capital can also refer to social and institutional capital. Social behavioral tendencies toward greater trust and reciprocity, and political or economic innovations such as improved protection of property rights, are all types of human capital that can enhance economic productivity.

## Why is Economic Growth Important?

In simple terms, economic growth means more people will get more things, which is why governments try to create it. However, this is not just about money, goods, and services. Politics also enters the equation. How to leverage economic growth to drive social progress is crucial.

According to research by the United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research, "Most countries that have succeeded in reducing poverty and increasing access to public goods have built this progress on strong economic growth." However, the institute points out that growth cannot be sustained if the benefits flow only to an elite group.[5]

## How Does Taxation Affect Economic Growth?

Taxation affects economic growth through its impact on demand, at least in the short term. Tax cuts increase demand by raising personal disposable income and encouraging business hiring and investment. However, the magnitude of the impact depends on the strength of the economy. If the economy is operating near full capacity, the impact may be small. If the economy is operating well below its potential, the impact will be more pronounced. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the impact in the latter case is three times greater than in the former case. [6]

The CBO also found that tax cuts are generally less effective at stimulating economic growth than increases in government spending. This is because most spending stimulates demand, while tax cuts stimulate both savings and demand. One way to mitigate this effect is to target tax cuts toward low and middle-income households, which are less likely to put the money into savings. [6]

## What are other words or terms for economic growth?

Other words and terms for economic growth include "prosperity," "economic development," "economic upswing," "economic boom," "industrial development," and "economic vitality."

## Conclusion

Economic growth occurs when the production of goods and services increases in a specific period compared to the previous period. It is typically measured by GDP and serves as an indicator of a country's economic health. However, the extent to which the benefits of growth are widely shared is a crucial factor in its sustainability, not to mention social health and progress.
