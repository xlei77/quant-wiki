## What is Margin Trading?

Margin trading refers to investors borrowing money from banks or brokers to purchase assets. Margin trading refers to the initial payment made by investors for assets—for example, a 10% down payment with 90% financing. Investors use marginable securities in their brokerage accounts as collateral.

The buying power in an investor's brokerage account reflects the total amount they can purchase utilizing any margin capacity. Short sellers of stocks also use margin for stock trading.

### Key Points

- Margin trading means you are investing with borrowed funds.
- Margin trading amplifies both gains and losses.
- If your account falls below the maintenance margin requirement, your broker can sell part or all of your portfolio to restore the account balance.

## Understanding Margin Trading

The Federal Reserve sets regulations for margin securities. As of 2023, under Federal Reserve Regulation T, investors must pay at least 50% of a security's purchase price in cash or other collateral. Investors can borrow the remaining 50% from brokers or dealers.

However, many brokers set higher margin requirements for their clients. Additionally, certain securities cannot be purchased on margin.

Like any loan, when investors purchase securities on margin, they must eventually repay the borrowed amount plus interest, which varies among different brokerage firms. Monthly principal and interest are charged to the investor's brokerage account.

In summary, margin trading means individuals are investing with borrowed money. Despite its benefits, this practice remains risky for investors with limited funds.

## Margin Trading Example

To understand how margin trading works, we'll simplify the process by not considering monthly interest costs. Although interest affects returns and losses, its impact is not significant compared to the principal margin amount itself.

Suppose an investor purchases 100 shares of XYZ Company stock at $100 per share. The investor pays half of the purchase price with their own funds, and the other half through margin financing, with an initial cash outlay of $5,000. One year later, the stock price rises to $200. The investor sells the stock for $20,000 and repays the $5,000 loan to the broker.

In this example, the investor's capital tripled, earning $15,000 on a $5,000 investment. If the investor had purchased the same number of shares with their own funds alone, their investment would have only doubled from $5,000 to $10,000.

Consider another scenario where one year later, the stock price falls to $50. The investor sells at a loss, receiving $5,000. This exactly equals the amount owed to the broker, resulting in a 100% loss on the investment. If the investor hadn't used margin trading, they would still have incurred a loss, but only 50% of their investment—$2,500 instead of $5,000.

## How to Trade on Margin

Brokers set minimum or initial margin and maintenance margin requirements that investors must maintain in their accounts before beginning margin trading. This amount is primarily based on the investor's credit rating. The maintenance margin is the minimum balance required by the broker that must be maintained in the investor's brokerage account.

For example, if an investor deposits $15,000 with a maintenance margin requirement of 50%, which is $7,500, and if the investor's equity falls below $7,500, they may receive a margin call. At this point, the investor must deposit funds with the broker as requested to restore the account balance to the required maintenance margin level.

Investors can either deposit cash or sell securities purchased with borrowed money. If the investor does not comply, the broker may liquidate the investor's collateral to restore the maintenance margin.

## Who Should Trade on Margin?

Generally speaking, margin trading is not suitable for beginners. It requires a certain risk tolerance, and any trading using margin needs close monitoring. Watching a stock portfolio lose and gain value over time is already quite a stressful experience for those without additional leverage. Moreover, during stock market crashes, the potential for massive losses makes margin trading challenging even for the most experienced investors.

However, certain types of trading, such as commodity futures trading, almost always require the use of margin, while other securities, like options contracts, are traditionally purchased with full cash. Options buyers can now purchase stock options and stock index options on margin, provided the options have more than nine months until expiration. The initial (maintenance) margin requirement is 75% of the cost (market value) of listed long-term stock or stock index call or put options.

For most individual investors who primarily focus on stocks and bonds, using margin trading introduces unnecessary risk.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Margin Trading

Margin trading allows investors to conduct larger-scale transactions beyond what their own assets could normally support by leveraging their existing assets. For skilled traders, this means they can take advantage of market opportunities even with relatively limited investment capital.

Margin trading enables traders to utilize their existing assets without having to sell them. If traders were to liquidate their existing stocks into cash, it might trigger taxable events that could offset potential investment gains. However, traders using existing stocks as margin collateral can trade without selling their stocks.

While margin traders can achieve higher profits, they may also face greater losses. There is even the possibility that margin traders' losses could exceed their original investment amount—meaning they would need to use additional assets to cover the difference.

Beyond the risks, traders must pay additional fees for margin positions. These fees typically run around 10%, depending on the federal funds rate.

For example, as of January 13, 2023, Fidelity Investments charged interest rates between 8.25% and 12.575% on margin loans, based on the size of the trader's margin position. If a position takes a long time to become profitable, these fees could offset any expected returns.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Margin Trading

#### Advantages

- Higher returns
- No need to liquidate existing assets

#### Disadvantages

- Higher risk
- Additional margin costs

## How Does Margin Trading Work?

Margin traders deposit cash or securities as collateral to borrow funds for trading. In the stock market, they can typically borrow up to 50% of the total trading cost, with the remainder coming from their margin collateral. They then use the borrowed cash for speculative trading. If a trader loses too much money, the broker will liquidate the trader's collateral to cover the losses.

## Why Does Margin Trading Lead to Problems?

Prior to the 1929 stock market crash, margin trading encouraged speculation because traders could achieve quick gains with relatively small investments. These gains further encouraged more margin trading, creating a bubble that pushed asset prices higher. When the bubble burst, many of these margin traders were left with debts they couldn't repay.

## Why is Margin Trading Risky?

Margin trading offers higher potential returns than conventional investments but also faces greater risks of losses. During bull markets, these returns can be quite tempting, but when trades go wrong, investors may end up owing more than their initial tradable capital.

## Conclusion

Margin trading refers to investors borrowing funds using their securities as collateral to engage in speculative trading. During bull markets, margin trading can provide traders with much higher returns compared to investing only available assets. However, margin trading can also lead to greater losses.
