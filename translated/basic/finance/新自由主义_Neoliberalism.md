## What is Neoliberalism?

Neoliberalism is a policy model that encompasses both political and economic aspects. It favors private enterprise and seeks to transfer control of economic factors from the government to the private sector.

Many neoliberal policies are associated with the effective operation of free-market capitalism and focus on limiting government spending, government regulation, and public ownership.

Neoliberalism is commonly associated with the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, who served as British Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990 (and Conservative Party leader from 1975 to 1990), and Ronald Reagan, who served as the 40th President of the United States from 1981 to 1989.[1]2

More recently, neoliberalism has been linked to austerity policies and attempts to reduce government spending on social programs.

### Key Takeaways

- Neoliberal policies typically support fiscal austerity, deregulation, free trade, privatization, and reduced government spending.
- Neoliberalism is commonly associated with the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Reagan in the US.
- There are many criticisms of neoliberalism, including its potential dangers to democracy, harm to workers' rights, and its organization of society and economy around markets that are far less rational than assumed.
- It is also accused of giving corporations too much power and exacerbating economic inequality.

## Understanding Neoliberalism

Neoliberalism is a political and economic philosophy that emphasizes free trade, deregulation, globalization, and reduced government spending. It is related to laissez-faire economics, a school of thought that advocates minimal government intervention in individual and societal economic matters.

Laissez-faire economics is a philosophy that believes minimal state intervention and participation in the economy will maximize economic growth and prosperity.

Furthermore, neoliberalism is sometimes confused with libertarianism. However, compared to libertarianism, neoliberals typically advocate for more government intervention in economic and social matters. For example, while neoliberals generally favor progressive taxation with low rates, libertarians tend to advocate for a low flat tax or the complete elimination of income tax. The two also often differ philosophically. Libertarians focus on economic freedom and rights, while neoliberals are more concerned with free market economics as a means to achieve greater growth objectives.

Moreover, neoliberals typically do not oppose measures such as bailouts of major industries, which are abhorrent to libertarians.

## Characteristics of Neoliberalism

Neoliberalism encompasses the belief that greater economic freedom leads to greater economic and social progress for individuals. It supports:

- The importance of free enterprise, competition, deregulation, and personal responsibility
- Opposition to the expansion of government power, state welfare, and inflation
- Minimizing government control over industry and promoting private sector ownership of businesses and property
- Free market capitalism and efficient allocation of resources
- Free trade, rather than strictly regulated markets and protectionism
- Reduction in government spending and lower taxation
- Reduced government control over economic activities to improve economic efficiency
- Increased private sector influence over the economy
- Reduction in union power and increased employment flexibility
- Government intervention when needed to implement, maintain, and protect free market activities

**Note:** President Jimmy Carter's deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 is an example of neoliberal policy. The Airline Deregulation Act eliminated government control over fares, routes, and who could enter the market. [3]

## Liberalism vs. Neoliberalism

At its core, liberalism is a broad political philosophy. It places freedom at a high standard and defines various aspects of society, economy, and politics, including the role of government.

Neoliberalism is essentially an economic ideology. Neoliberal policies are more narrow in scope, primarily focusing on markets and policies and measures that affect the economy.

## Criticisms of Neoliberalism

There are many criticisms of neoliberalism.

A common criticism of neoliberalism is that advocating free-market approaches in areas such as healthcare and education is misguided, as these services are public services. Public services are not subject to the same profit motives as other industries.

More importantly, adopting free-market approaches in healthcare and education can lead to increased inequality and underfunding of resources (healthcare and education) that are essential for the long-term health and viability of the economy.

The adoption of neoliberal policies in the Western world has coincided with increasing wealth and income inequality. While skilled workers may be able to obtain higher wages, less-skilled workers are more likely to see their wages stagnate.

Some argue that policies associated with neoliberalism encourage the existence of monopolies, increasing corporate profits at the expense of consumers.[4]

Contrary to what neoliberalism's supporters typically claim, capital deregulation does not necessarily contribute to economic development. Instead, capital deregulation leads to increased financial instability, including economic events that sometimes send shockwaves around the world.

In fact, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) report on neoliberalism shows that increased capital flows are a factor in increasing the risk of adverse economic cycles.[5]

Research shows that neoliberal policies exacerbate inequality. This inequality can hamper the economy's long-term growth prospects. On one hand, those with lower incomes have limited consumption capacity. Meanwhile, those who become wealthier have a higher propensity to save.[6]

In the latter case, wealth does not trickle down as neoliberalism's supporters claim.

Finally, neoliberalism's emphasis on economic efficiency encourages globalization, which opponents say leads to factory closures and jobs moving overseas.

Opponents of neoliberalism also claim that its call for replacing government-owned companies with private corporations can cause various forms of social harm, such as reducing access to basic services and damaging workers' rights.

Furthermore, those who oppose neoliberalism claim it is anti-democratic and can lead to exploitation and social injustice. They also claim it can result in corporations using their power and resources to subvert the will of the majority. Others assert that it leads to support for undemocratic regimes that implement neoliberal economics.

## In Simple Terms, What is Neoliberalism?

It is an economic model or philosophy emphasizing that greater economic and social progress can be achieved in a free society when government regulation is minimized, government spending and taxation are reduced, and the government does not exercise strict control over the economy. Neoliberalism does not oppose all government intervention. However, it does seek to limit it to only what is necessary to support free markets and free enterprise.

## What are the impacts of neoliberalism?

Some impacts may include more liberalized markets, greater access to products and services to meet consumer demands, higher incomes, and increased profits. Price reductions due to greater competition might also be an impact. More efficient allocation of resources can lead to savings. Better organization of labor and the ability to hire needed talent for specific jobs may come from neoliberal policies. Others might point to some negative impacts thought to be associated with neoliberalism. These may include economic inequality, growth of monopolies, lack of job security, loss of jobs due to outsourcing, and increasing indifference to individual needs and well-being.

## What are examples of neoliberalism?

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is one example. Through this agreement, Canada, Mexico, and the United States agreed to eliminate all trade restrictions between their countries to open up trade and increase the economic benefits for each country.

## Bottom Line

Broadly speaking, neoliberalism is an economic policy position that advocates for limited government role in the economy and privatization of all functions that can be privatized. Like many economic policy ideas and theories, neoliberalism has both advantages and disadvantages.
