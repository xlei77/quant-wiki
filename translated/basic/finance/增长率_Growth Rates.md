## What is Growth Rate?

Growth rate refers to the percentage change in a variable over a specific time period. Growth rates can be positive or negative, depending on whether the scale of the variable increases or decreases over time. Growth rates were first used by biologists to study population sizes, but were later widely applied to studies of economic activities, business management, or investment returns.

For investors, growth rate typically represents the annual compound growth rate of investments, or a company's revenue, profits, or dividends. Growth rates are also applied to more macro concepts, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and unemployment rates. Expected forward-looking growth rates and historical growth rates are two commonly used types of growth rates in analysis.

### Key Points

- Growth rate is used to express the annual change of variables in percentage form.
- A positive growth rate indicates that a variable increases over time; a negative growth rate indicates that a variable decreases over time.
- Growth rates help evaluate company performance and predict future performance.
- Growth rate is calculated by dividing the difference between the end value and initial value of the analyzed period by the initial value.
- Time periods for growth rates typically include annual, quarterly, monthly, and weekly.

## Understanding Growth Rate

At the most basic level, growth rate is used to express the annual change of a variable in percentage terms. For example, an economy's growth rate is derived from the annual rate of change in GDP. This growth rate is used to measure economic contraction or expansion. If a country's income declines for two consecutive quarters, it is considered to be in recession.

Conversely, if the country's income increases for two consecutive quarters, it is considered to be in expansion.

## How to Calculate Growth Rate

There are multiple methods for calculating growth rates, depending on what numbers need to be conveyed. A simple growth rate is calculated by dividing the difference between the ending value and beginning value by the beginning value, i.e., (EV-BV)/BV. A country's GDP growth rate can be calculated as:

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{经济增长} = \frac { \text{GDP}_2 - \text{GDP}_1 }{ \text{GDP}_1 } \\ &\textbf{其中:} \\ &\text{GDP} = \text{国家的国内生产总值} \\ \end{aligned} $$

However, this method may be overly simplistic.

Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is a variant of growth rate commonly used to evaluate investment or company performance. CAGR is not a true rate of return, but rather describes the growth rate as if the investment had grown at a constant rate annually with profits reinvested at year-end. The formula for calculating CAGR is:

$$ \begin{aligned} &CAGR= \left ( \frac{EV}{BV} \right ) ^{\frac{1}{n}}-1\\ &\textbf{其中:}\\ &EV = \text{期末值}\\ &BV = \text{期初值}\\ &n = \text{年数} \end{aligned} $$

CAGR calculation assumes growth is steady over a specific time period. Due to its simplicity and flexibility, CAGR is a widely used metric, and many businesses use it to report and forecast earnings growth.

Financial theory suggests that a company's stock can be reasonably valued using the Dividend Discount Model (DDM), where the value based on current price equals the sum of the present values of all future dividend payments. Therefore, dividend growth rate is important for stock valuation.

The Gordon Growth Model (GGM) is a popular method used to determine the intrinsic value of a stock based on a future series of dividends that grow at a constant rate. It assumes mature companies regularly seek to increase dividend payments to investors, making the dividend growth rate a key input for stock valuation.

## Using Growth Rates

Analysts, investors, and company management use growth rates to regularly evaluate company growth and make predictions about future performance. Typically, growth rate calculations are used for a company's earnings, sales, or cash flow, but investors also pay attention to growth rates of other metrics such as P/E ratios or book value. When public companies report quarterly earnings, they usually disclose headline figures for earnings and revenue, along with growth rates calculated quarterly or annually.

For example, Amazon reported annual revenue of $575 billion for 2023, a 12% increase from $514 billion in 2022.[1]

Internal Growth Rate (IGR) is a specific type of growth rate used to measure the return on investment or project performance or company performance. It represents the highest level of growth a business can achieve without external financing, while a company's maximum IGR is the level of business operations that can sustain financing and growth.

Investors typically look at Rate of Return (RoR) calculations to compute the growth rate of their portfolio or investments. While this usually follows the formula for growth rate or CAGR, investors may also want to know their real return rate or after-tax return rate. Therefore, investors' growth rates will subtract the effects of taxes, inflation, and transaction costs or fees.

**Note**: Because stock prices are considered to reflect the discounted value of a company's future cash flows, rising stock markets suggest improved projected growth rates for companies.

Growth rates are also industry-specific. Each industry has a unique benchmark growth rate used to measure relative performance. For example, companies at the technological frontier are more likely to have higher annual growth rates compared to mature industries like retail. Industry growth rates can be used as comparison points for companies to evaluate their performance relative to peers.

Using historical growth rates is one of the simplest methods to estimate future industry growth. However, historically high growth rates don't always indicate high future growth rates, as industrial and economic environments constantly change and are often cyclical. For example, the automotive industry has higher revenue growth rates during periods of economic expansion, while during recessions, consumers tend to be more frugal and don't use disposable income for new car purchases.

Besides GDP growth, retail sales growth is another important economic growth rate as it can reflect consumer confidence and spending habits. When the economy is good and people are confident, consumption increases, which is reflected in retail sales. When the economy is in recession, people reduce spending, and retail sales decline.

For example, Ireland's Central Statistics Office reported the country's retail sales growth for the past year in August 2023, showing domestic retail sales increased by 5.9% over the previous twelve months. However, retail sales excluding motor trades remained relatively flat with only a 0.3% increase, indicating the relative importance of automotive sales. Department stores, electrical goods, and food and beverage sectors experienced negative growth.[2]

## Growth Rate Examples

Suppose we are comparing the annual GDP growth rates of two countries.

- Country A is a developed economy with a large, technically skilled population. Its GDP over three years is:
- Year 1: $1.20 trillion
- Year 2: $1.26 trillion (growth y1 to y2 = 6/120 = 5.0%)
- Year 3: $1.29 trillion (growth y2 to y3 = 3/126 = 2.4%)
- Country B is a developing economy with rapidly growing population and moderate technical level, having low-skilled but cost-effective labor force. Its GDP during the same period is:
- Year 1: $20 billion
- Year 2: $25 billion (growth y1 to y2 = 50/200 = 25.0%)
- Year 3: $35 billion (growth y2 to y3 = 100/250 = 40.0%)

First, we can look at the annual growth rates of both countries in the first two years. Country A's growth rate is moderate and shows a declining trend over three years, while Country B grows rapidly with accelerating growth. This is not uncommon for large mature nations versus emerging market economies. However, it's worth noting that in the third year, Country A's economy is still more than 36 times larger than Country B's.

We can also consider the CAGR between the first and third years for both countries. We get:

- CAGRA = (1.29/1.20)^(1/2) - 1 = 3.68% per year
- CAGRB = (35/20)^(1/2) - 1 = 32.29% per year

Note that the annualized CAGR rates are slightly lower than the arithmetic mean of the two years' respective growth rates.

## Limitations of Growth Rates

Although growth rates are crucial for understanding how quickly things change over time, they have several important limitations. First, growth rates only focus on the net change between two points in time, without considering potential price movements or volatility in between. For example, if a variable has a value of 10.00 today and remains 10.00 one year later, the growth rate is zero. However, during these 12 months, it might have experienced dramatic fluctuations or remained completely static. In this case, the annual growth rate tells us nothing about this relevant information.

Growth rates also ignore the nominal amounts involved. For instance, a company's earnings might grow from $100,000 to $150,000, representing a 50% growth but only a $50,000 change. On the other hand, a larger company B might only grow earnings by 5% annually (10 times lower in growth rate terms), but this could translate to millions of dollars in revenue.

Finally, growth rates are difficult to compare across industries or between different variables. A 5% growth rate for a company could mean very different things depending on whether it's a growth-focused tech startup or a large traditional consumer goods manufacturer. Similarly, a 4% decrease in unemployment rate does not necessarily have the same impact as a 4% growth in GDP.

## How to Calculate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Growth Rate?

According to the above formula, the GDP growth rate is calculated by finding the difference between current and previous GDP levels, then dividing it by the previous GDP level. The real economic (real GDP) growth rate takes inflation into account by replacing nominal GDP with real GDP in both numerator and denominator, where real GDP = GDP / (1 + inflation rate since base year).

## What is a Normal Company Growth Rate?

A company's growth rate that is considered good depends on multiple factors, such as the industry, whether it's a startup or mature company, the company's size, and overall economic conditions. Generally, a company's growth rate should exceed nominal GDP growth and inflation rates. New companies in higher-risk industries need higher growth rates to meet investor expectations.

## What is a Good Growth Rate for Startups?

Startups, especially those in high-tech industries, are typically expected to grow quite rapidly. For Y Combinator companies (a renowned tech incubator), a good growth rate is considered to be 5% to 7% revenue growth per week, while an excellent growth rate is 10% per week[3]. Therefore, a startup might grow by 150% or more in its first few months. As the company matures, the growth rate will decrease.

## How to Calculate Growth Rate in Excel?

Since growth rate calculations follow relatively simple formulas, they can be easily imported into spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel to speed up calculations and reduce human error. You only need to provide the initial value, final value, and the number of periods (for example, when using Compound Annual Growth Rate [CAGR]). It's worth noting that newer versions of Excel also have a built-in rate of return (RoR) function that can calculate CAGR in one step, called [RRI]. However, the RRI function uses three parameters: number of periods, starting value, and ending value.

## How to Calculate Population Growth Rate?

Similar to calculating other growth rates, population growth rate can be calculated by subtracting the previous population size from the current population size. Then, divide this value by the previous size and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.

## Conclusion

Growth rate measures the speed at which a variable increases or decreases, showing the net change in value over a specific time period. Originally applied to the study of biological populations and diseases, growth rates have now become an important consideration for economists, policymakers, corporate managers, entrepreneurs, and investors. Calculating the growth rate simply requires dividing the difference in values over the observation period (such as one year) by the initial value.
