## What are Open Market Operations (OMOs)?

Open Market Operations (OMO) refers to the Federal Reserve System's (Fed) buying and selling of securities in the open market. The Fed conducts open market operations to regulate the money supply in U.S. bank reserves. The Fed purchases Treasury securities to increase the money supply and sells Treasury securities to decrease the money supply.

By using OMOs, the Fed can adjust the federal funds rate, which in turn influences other short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates, and foreign exchange rates. This can alter the amount of money and credit available in the economy and affect certain economic factors, such as unemployment rates, output, and the cost of goods and services.

### Key Points

- Open market operations are one of three tools used by the Federal Reserve to influence money and credit supply.
- The term refers to the central bank's buying and selling of securities in the open market to influence the money supply.
- The Fed uses open market operations to manipulate interest rates, starting with the federal funds rate used in interbank lending.
- Purchasing securities injects money into the system, lowers interest rates, makes borrowing more accessible, and increases economic activity.
- Selling securities removes money from the system, raises interest rates, makes borrowing more expensive, and reduces economic activity.

## Understanding Open Market Operations (OMOs)

To understand open market operations, you must first grasp how the Federal Reserve (the central bank of the United States) implements the nation's monetary policy.

To keep the U.S. economy running smoothly and prevent adverse effects from uncontrolled price inflation or deflation, the Federal Reserve Board sets what is known as the federal funds rate target.[1]

The federal funds rate is the rate at which depository institutions charge each other for overnight loans. This continuous flow of funds allows banks to earn returns on their excess cash in Federal Reserve accounts while maintaining necessary reserves to meet customer demands.[2]

As a benchmark, the federal funds rate influences various other interest rates, from savings deposit rates to home mortgage rates and credit card rates.[1]

Open market operations are one of the tools the Fed uses to keep the federal funds rate at its established target level.

The U.S. central bank can lower interest rates by purchasing securities (and injecting funds into the money supply). Similarly, it can sell securities from its balance sheet, removing funds from circulation and exerting upward pressure on interest rates.

The Federal Reserve Board sets the federal funds rate target, and then the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) implements open market operations to achieve that rate.[3]

## Types of Open Market Operations

There are two types of OMO: permanent open market operations and temporary open market operations.

Permanent open market operations refer to the Federal Reserve's outright purchase or sale of securities for its portfolio. Permanent OMOs are used to achieve traditional objectives. For example, the Fed will adjust its asset holdings to exert downward pressure on long-term interest rates and improve financial conditions for consumers and businesses. Permanent OMOs are also used to reinvest principal received from currently held securities.[4]

Temporary open market operations are used to increase or decrease reserves available to the banking system in the short term. They address reserve needs that are considered temporary. Unlike permanent OMOs that involve outright purchases or sales, temporary OMOs are temporary transactions. They are either repurchase agreements (repos) or reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos).[4]

A repurchase agreement is a transaction where the Fed's trading desk buys securities and agrees to sell them back at a future date. A reverse repurchase agreement is when the Fed sells securities and agrees to buy them back in the future. Overnight reverse repos are currently used by the Fed to maintain its federal funds rate within the target range set by the FOMC.[4]

**Note:** U.S. Treasury securities, or Treasuries, are government-issued notes and bonds that many individual consumers purchase. Various types of financial institutions also buy and hold them in large quantities. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the government and are considered safe investments. Treasuries are first issued by the government and then traded in the secondary market.

## Expansionary and Contractionary Monetary Policy

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy can be either expansionary or contractionary.[5]

If the Fed's goal is to expand the money supply and stimulate demand, the policy is expansionary. The Fed will purchase government securities to inject cash into banks. This encourages banks to lend excess funds that they are not required to keep in reserve to consumers and businesses.

As banks compete for customers, interest rates gradually decline. Consumers are able to borrow more money to buy more things. Businesses are eager to borrow more money to expand.[5]

If the Fed's goal is to contract the money supply and reduce demand, the policy is contractionary. The Fed will sell government securities to drain funds from the system. Less money in the economy means interest rates gradually rise and borrowing decreases. Consumers reduce spending. Businesses scale back their growth plans. Economic activity slows down.[5]

## Advantages of Open Market Operations

Open market operations allow the Federal Reserve System (or central banks of other countries) to prevent price inflation or deflation without directly intervening in the market economy. The Fed doesn't need to use regulations to control lending, but rather simply raises or lowers the cost of borrowing.

This enables the Federal Reserve System to moderate business cycles and reduce economic shocks. During recessions, the central bank lowers borrowing costs to encourage business activity and growth. During bubble periods, the Fed raises borrowing costs to curb speculation and eliminate potential bubbles.

Open market operations can also be used to influence employment growth. By lowering interest rates, the Fed can make it easier to start businesses and hire workers, thereby increasing employment.

## Examples of Open Market Operations

In 2019, the Federal Reserve System used temporary OMOs (term and overnight repos) to support healthy bank reserve supplies in response to what it called "periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities" and to "mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation." [6]

It also used repos to offset pressures caused by COVID in 2020 and ensure banks could maintain adequate reserves. The repos also helped accommodate "smooth functioning of short-term dollar funding markets." [6]

## Open Market Operations vs. Quantitative Easing

As mentioned above, open market operations are one of the policy tools frequently used by the Federal Reserve to expand the money supply and support economic activity, or to contract the money supply and slow down such activity.

Quantitative Easing (QE) is another non-traditional tool used by the Federal Reserve for monetary policy purposes. Essentially, it involves large-scale securities purchases to stimulate or stabilize the economy.

The Federal Reserve typically adopts quantitative easing policies after other monetary policy tools have been used but additional measures are still needed to promote slow lending and economic activity. For example, quantitative easing might be used when interest rates are already low but economic output remains below levels the Federal Reserve considers healthy.

## Why Does the Federal Reserve Conduct Open Market Operations?

The Federal Reserve uses open market operations to move the federal funds rate and influence other interest rates. This is done to stimulate or slow down the economy. The Fed can increase the money supply and lower the federal funds rate by purchasing (typically) Treasury securities. Similarly, it can raise the federal funds rate by selling securities from its balance sheet. This removes money from circulation and forces interest rates to rise.

## What is Permanent Open Market Operations?

The term "Permanent Open Market Operations" refers to the central bank's outright purchase or sale of securities (which will not be reversed in the short term) to adjust the money supply. Permanent OMO contrasts with temporary open market operations, which involve repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, aimed at temporarily adding reserves to or draining reserves from the banking system.[7]

## What is the Federal Funds Rate?

The Federal Funds Rate is the overnight interest rate at which depository institutions lend available balances held at the Federal Reserve to one another.

## How Does the Federal Funds Rate Affect Banks?

Financial institutions typically determine interest rates for consumer and commercial loans based on the federal funds rate. For example, as the Federal Reserve conducts OMO (Open Market Operations) to raise or lower the federal funds rate, banks and credit card companies will adjust their rates accordingly.

## Conclusion

In open market operations, the Federal Reserve System buys and sells securities in the open market to increase or decrease interest rates. They are one of the tools available to the Fed to stimulate or slow down the nation's economic activity. Through participation in open market operations, the Fed can inject funds into or withdraw funds from the nation's money supply.

Open market operations can be permanent or temporary. Permanent OMOs involve outright purchases (or sales) of securities. Temporary OMOs involve buying or selling securities with an agreement to reverse the transaction in the near future.
