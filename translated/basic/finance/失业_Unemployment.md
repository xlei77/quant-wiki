## What is Unemployment?

Unemployment refers to a situation where a person is actively seeking work but unable to find employment. Unemployment is considered a key indicator for measuring the health of an economy. The most commonly used measure of unemployment is the unemployment rate. It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed people by the total labor force.

### Key Points

- Unemployment occurs when people who want to work cannot find jobs.
- High unemployment rates indicate economic distress, while extremely low unemployment rates may signal an overheating economy.
- Unemployment can be categorized as frictional, cyclical, structural, or institutional unemployment.
- Unemployment data is collected and published by government agencies in various ways.
- Many governments provide small incomes to unemployed individuals through unemployment insurance, as long as they meet certain requirements.

## Understanding Unemployment

Unemployment is a key economic indicator as it demonstrates workers' ability (or inability) to obtain gainful employment and contribute to the economy's productive output. The more unemployed workers there are, the lower the overall economic output.

The definition of unemployment does not include people who have left the labor market due to reasons such as retirement, higher education, and disability. [1]

Unemployed workers must maintain at least subsistence-level consumption during their period of unemployment. This means that economies with high unemployment rates have lower output, while the demand for basic consumption does not decrease proportionally.

High and persistent unemployment rates may signal serious economic distress and could even lead to social and political unrest.

On the other hand, low unemployment rates suggest that the economy is more likely to be producing near its full capacity, maximizing output, driving wage growth, and improving living standards over time.

However, extremely low unemployment rates can also be a warning sign, indicating an overheating economy, inflationary pressures, and stress on businesses that need more workers.

While unemployment has a clear definition, economists categorize unemployment into many different types. The two broadest categories are voluntary and involuntary unemployment. When unemployment is voluntary, it means a person voluntarily leaves their job to search for other work. When unemployment is involuntary, it means a person has been fired or laid off and must now search for another job. [2]

## Types of Unemployment

Voluntary and involuntary unemployment can be classified into four types. We will focus on explaining them below.

This type of unemployment is usually temporary. From an economic perspective, it is also the least problematic. It occurs when people voluntarily change jobs. After leaving a company, a person naturally needs time to find another job. Similarly, recent graduates entering the labor market for the first time also contribute to frictional unemployment.

Frictional unemployment is a natural result of market processes taking time and information being costly. Finding new jobs, recruiting new employees, and matching suitable workers with suitable jobs all require time and effort. This leads to frictional unemployment.

Cyclical unemployment refers to changes in the number of unemployed workers during economic ups and downs (such as those related to oil price changes). The unemployment rate rises during economic recessions and falls during periods of economic growth.

Preventing and mitigating cyclical unemployment during economic downturns is one of the key reasons for studying economics and the various policy tools governments use to stimulate the economy during business cycle downturns.

Structural unemployment results from technological changes in the economic structure of how labor markets function. Technological changes can lead to unemployment among workers whose jobs are no longer needed. Examples of such changes include the replacement of horse-drawn transportation with automobiles and the automation of manufacturing.

Retraining these workers can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. Unemployed workers often end up being unemployed long-term or leaving the labor force entirely.

Institutional unemployment stems from long-term or permanent institutional factors and incentives in the economy. The following factors can all lead to institutional unemployment:

- Government policies, such as high minimum wage standards, generous social benefit programs, and restrictive occupational licensing laws
- Labor market phenomena, including efficiency wages and discriminatory hiring
- Labor market institutions, such as high unionization rates

**Important Note:** Many governments provide unemployment insurance to certain eligible unemployed individuals.

## How to Measure Unemployment Rate

The U.S. government tracks unemployment rates using surveys, census counts, and unemployment insurance claims.

The U.S. Census Bureau conducts a monthly survey called the "Current Population Survey (CPS)" on behalf of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to generate the primary estimate of the nation's unemployment rate. This survey has been conducted monthly since 1940.

The sample consists of approximately 60,000 eligible households. This translates to about 110,000 individuals each month. The Census Bureau rotates a quarter of the sample households each month, so no household is represented for more than four consecutive months. This is done to strengthen the reliability of the estimates.[1]

There are several different versions of the unemployment rate, with varying definitions of who is unemployed and who is in the labor force.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics typically cites the U-3 unemployment rate (defined as total unemployed as a percentage of the civilian labor force) as the official unemployment rate; however, this definition does not include discouraged unemployed workers who are no longer looking for work.[3]

Other unemployment categories include discouraged workers and part-time or underemployed workers who want full-time work but cannot do so for economic reasons.[4]

## Unemployment History

Although the U.S. government began tracking unemployment rates in the 1940s, the highest unemployment rate to date occurred during the Great Depression, when it rose to 24.9% in 1933.

Between 1931 and 1940, unemployment rates remained above 14%, but subsequently fell to single digits. It stayed there until 1982, when it climbed above 10%. [5]

In 2009, during the Great Recession, unemployment rates rose above 10% again. In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment reached 14.8%. As of April 2024, the unemployment rate stands at 3.9%. [6]

## What are the main causes of unemployment?

There are many causes of unemployment. These causes include economic recession, depression, technological advancement, job outsourcing, and voluntarily leaving one job to search for another.

## What are the 3 Types of Unemployment?

Today's economists identify three main types of unemployment: frictional unemployment, structural unemployment, and cyclical unemployment. Frictional unemployment is the result of voluntary employment transitions within an economy. Frictional unemployment occurs naturally, as workers change jobs even in a growing, stable economy.

Structural unemployment can cause permanent disruption due to fundamental and permanent changes in the economic structure. These changes may marginalize a group of workers. They include technological changes, lack of relevant skills, and job relocation to another country overseas. Cyclical unemployment is related to unemployment that occurs during business cycle fluctuations.

## What is the strict definition of unemployment?

The official definition of unemployment comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which states that "people are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work."[1]

## Bottom Line

Unemployment refers to individuals who are not employed and actively seeking employment opportunities but are unable to find work. Unemployment is a key indicator for measuring economic health. A low unemployment rate represents a strong economy, while a high unemployment rate represents a weak economy.
