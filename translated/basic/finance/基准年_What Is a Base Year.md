## What is a Base Year?

A base year is the first year in a series of years for economic or financial indices. In this context, the base year is typically set to an arbitrary levelâ€”100. To keep the data current within a specific index, the base year is periodically updated. Base years are also used to measure company growth. Any year can serve as a base year, but analysts typically choose a recent year.

### Key Points

- The base year is the first year in a series of years in an economic or financial index.
- The base year is also used to measure business activities, such as the growth in sales from one period to the next.
- The base year can be any year, with the specific choice depending on the analysis being conducted.

## Understanding the Base Year

A base year is used to compare measurements of business activities or economic and financial indices. For example, to determine the inflation rate from 2016 to 2024, 2016 would be the base year or the first year in the time period. A base year can also describe the starting point from which growth is measured, or the baseline for calculating same-store sales.

Many financial ratios are growth-based because analysts want to understand how specific numbers change from one period to the next.

The growth rate formula is (Current Year - Base Year) / Base Year.

In ratio analysis, the past serves as the base period.

Growth analysis is a common method used to describe company performance, particularly in terms of sales. If Company A's sales increase from $100,000 to $140,000, this means the company's sales grew by 40%, where $100,000 represents the base year value.

**Note:** Investors can perform base year analysis on a company's financial statements to determine if its bottom line is growing consistently.

## Base Year and Horizontal Analysis

Horizontal analysis involves comparing financial data across multiple periods to track changes and trends. The base year serves as a reference point or benchmark for these comparisons, providing a measurement standard for current and future financial data.

When conducting year-over-year horizontal analysis, financial figures from the base year are used to calculate percentage changes in key metrics (such as revenue, net income, or expenses) in subsequent years. For example, if 2022 is the base year and the company's revenue was $1 million in that year, revenue data for 2023 and beyond will be compared against this base year to determine growth or decline. Horizontal analysis is relatively straightforward, especially for public companies that must publish these year-over-year financial figures quarterly.

## Base Year and Same-Store Sales Calculation

Companies are always looking for ways to increase sales. One way companies grow sales is by opening new stores or branches. New stores show high growth rates because they start from zero, and every new store sale represents incremental revenue. Therefore, analysts focus on other factors, such as same-store sales growth. This is also known as measuring comparable store or same-store sales.

In same-store sales calculations, the base year represents the starting point for both the number of stores and the sales generated by these stores. If Company A has 100 stores with total sales of $100,000 last year, the average sales per store would be $1,000. This is the base year. Under this method, the base year establishes the baseline for both sales figures and store count.

Suppose Company A opens another 100 stores the following year, generating $50,000 in sales, while same-store sales declined 10% from $100,000 to $90,000. The company can report sales growth from $100,000 to $140,000, a 40% increase, but astute analysts are more interested in the 10% decline in same-store sales.

## Base Year and Real Estate Leasing

The concept of base year can also be found in real estate. In commercial real estate, the base year is used to determine a tenant's responsibility for certain operating expenses during the lease term. The base year typically refers to the first complete year of the lease. The expenses during this period serve as a benchmark or baseline for calculating any future cost increases that the tenant may be responsible for.

For example, if the base year of a lease is set to 2024, and the operating expenses for that year are $100,000, then the tenant will be responsible for their share of any expenses exceeding $100,000 in subsequent years. If expenses rise to $110,000 in 2025, the tenant will pay their portion of the $10,000 increase.

Another aspect of the base year relates to rent escalation. In the commercial sector, long-term leases might cover a 10-year term with a 4% annual increase. If the base year rent is $1 million per year, then each subsequent year's rent will be 4% higher than the previous year (escalating from the base year's $1 million). The rent for the first year after the base year would be $1.04 million.

## How is the Base Year Used?

The base year is used for comparing or measuring business activities, economic or financial indices. For example, the base year is used in calculating same-store sales. The base year is also used in calculating Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

## How to Choose the Base Year?

The choice of base year depends on the analysis being conducted. For example, a company established in 2021 can use that year as a benchmark for measuring future sales growth.

## How to Calculate Growth Rate?

The growth rate can be calculated by dividing the difference between the ending value and the starting value of the analysis period by the starting value. The growth rate formula is (current year - base year) / base year. The base year represents the starting point for measuring growth.

## Conclusion

The base year is used in economic and financial indices, as well as for measuring company growth. The selection of a base year depends on the analysis being conducted. When studying stocks, investors can perform base year analysis to track a company's growth and determine whether to invest in the company.
