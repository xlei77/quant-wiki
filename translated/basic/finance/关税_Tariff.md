## What is a Tariff?

Most countries are limited by their natural resources and their ability to produce specific goods and services. They trade with other countries to obtain items that their population needs and demands. However, trade between trading partners does not always occur in an amicable manner. Policies, geopolitics, competition, and many other factors can cause dissatisfaction among trading partners.

One way governments deal with trading partners they disagree with is through tariffs. A tariff is a tax imposed by one country on goods and services imported from another country, with the purpose of influencing that country, generating revenue, or protecting competitive advantages.

### Key Points

- Governments impose tariffs to increase revenue, protect domestic industries, or exert political influence over another country.
- Tariffs typically lead to adverse side effects, such as higher consumer prices.
- Tariffs have a long and controversial history, and debates about whether they constitute good or bad policy continue to be intense.

## Understanding Tariffs

Tariffs are used to restrict imports. In simple terms, they increase the price of goods and services purchased from another country, making them less attractive to domestic consumers.

A key point to understand is that tariffs affect exporting countries because consumers in the tariff-imposing country may avoid imported goods due to price increases. However, if consumers still choose to import products, the tariffs effectively raise costs for consumers in the other country.

There are two types of tariffs:

- Specific tariffs are fixed fees charged based on the type of goods, such as a $500 tariff on cars.
- Ad valorem tariffs are charged based on the value of goods, such as 5% of the imported goods' value.

## Why Does the Government Impose Tariffs

The government may impose tariffs for several reasons:

- Generate revenue
- Protect domestic industries
- Protect domestic consumers
- Protect national interests

Tariffs can be used to generate revenue for the government. These are known as revenue tariffs, and their purpose is not to restrict imports. For example, in 2018 and 2019, President Donald Trump and his administration imposed tariffs on many goods to rebalance trade deficits. In fiscal year 2018, tariffs received were $41.6 billion. In fiscal year 2019, tariffs received were $71.9 billion.[1]2

Governments can use tariffs to benefit specific industries, typically doing so to protect companies and jobs. For example, in April 2018, President Donald Trump imposed a 25% ad valorem tariff on steel products from all countries except Canada and Mexico.[3] In March 2022, President Joe Biden replaced the tariffs on steel products from the UK with a tariff-rate quota of 500,000 tons and reached quota agreements with several other countries.[4]5

This announcement reopened trade with the UK for specific goods while taking measures to protect domestic steel manufacturing and production jobs in the United States.

By making foreign-produced goods more expensive, tariffs can make domestically produced alternatives appear more attractive. Certain products manufactured in countries with less regulation might harm consumers, such as products coated with lead-based paint. Tariffs can make these products so expensive that consumers won't purchase them.

Tariffs can also be used as an extension of foreign policy, as levies on trading partners' main export products can be used to exert economic influence. For example, when Russia invaded Ukraine, most of the world protested by boycotting Russian goods or implementing sanctions. In April 2022, President Joe Biden suspended normal trade with Russia. In June, he raised tariffs to 35% on Russian imports that weren't prohibited by the April suspension.[6]

## Unexpected Side Effects of Tariffs

Tariffs can produce unexpected side effects:

- They can reduce efficiency and innovation in domestic industries by reducing competition.
- They may harm domestic consumers as lack of competition often drives prices higher.
- They can create tensions by favoring certain industries or geographic regions. For example, tariffs intended to help urban manufacturers may hurt consumers in rural areas who don't benefit from the policy and may pay higher prices for finished goods.
- Finally, attempts to pressure competing nations through the use of tariffs can evolve into an unproductive cycle of retaliation, commonly known as a trade war.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Tariffs

#### Advantages

- Generates income
- Initiates negotiations
- Supports national objectives
- Makes markets predictable

#### Disadvantages

- Creates problems between governments
- Triggers trade wars

- Generate Revenue: As mentioned earlier, tariffs provide governments with an opportunity to increase revenue. This can reduce some of the tax burden felt by a country's citizens and help governments reduce deficits.
- Initiate Negotiations: Countries can use tariffs to initiate negotiations on trade or other issues. Both parties can use tariffs to help them formulate economic policies and engage in dialogue with trading partners.
- Support National Goals: One of the most popular uses of tariffs is to use them to ensure domestic products receive preferential treatment within a country to support businesses and the economy.
- Make Markets Predictable: Tariffs can help stabilize markets and make prices predictable.

- Creates Problems Between Governments: Many countries use tariffs to punish or deter behavior they disapprove of. Unfortunately, doing so can create tensions between two countries and lead to more problems.
- Triggers Trade Wars: A typical response from a country subject to tariffs is to respond in kind, triggering a trade war from which neither side can benefit.

## History of Tariffs

In pre-modern Europe, a nation's wealth was considered to be fixed, tangible assets such as gold, silver, land, and other physical resources. Trade was viewed as a zero-sum game, resulting in either clear net losses or clear net gains. If a country's imports exceeded its exports, a resource, primarily gold, would flow abroad, thus depleting its wealth. Cross-border trade was viewed with suspicion, and countries preferred to acquire colonies and establish exclusive trading relationships with them rather than trade with each other.

This system, known as mercantilism, relied heavily on tariffs and even complete trade prohibitions. Colonial powers saw themselves in competition with other colonizers, importing raw materials from their colonies, which were typically forbidden from selling their raw materials elsewhere. The colonial power would transform these materials into finished goods and then sell them back to the colonies. High tariffs and other barriers were implemented to ensure colonies purchased manufactured goods only from their mother country.[7][8]

Scottish economist Adam Smith was among the first to question the wisdom of this arrangement. His "Wealth of Nations" was published in 1776, the same year Britain's American colonies declared independence in response to high taxes and restrictive trade arrangements.[9]

Later writers, such as David Ricardo, developed Smith's ideas further, resulting in the theory of comparative advantage. This theory suggests that if one country is better at producing a particular product and another country is better at producing something else, each should devote its resources to what it does best. Countries should trade with each other rather than erect barriers forcing them to divert resources to activities they're not good at. According to this theory, tariffs drag on economic growth, even if they can be used to benefit specific narrow sectors in some circumstances.[10]

**Note:** These two approaches—free trade based on comparative advantage on one hand, and restrictive trade based on zero-sum thinking on the other—have experienced fluctuations in popularity.

Relatively free trade enjoyed a heyday in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when international commerce had supposedly made large-scale war between nations so expensive and counterproductive that it was obsolete. World War I proved this notion wrong, and nationalist approaches to trade, including high tariffs, dominated until the end of World War II.[11]

Free trade has enjoyed a 50-year renaissance since then, culminating in the 1995 creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which serves as an international forum for dispute resolution and basic rule-setting.[12] Free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)—predecessor to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)—and the European Union (EU), also proliferated.[13]

However, skepticism of this model—sometimes labeled neoliberal by critics who link it to 19th-century liberal arguments for free trade—has grown, with Britain voting to leave the EU in 2016.[14] The same year, Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election with a platform that included calls for tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. He implemented tariffs on China after taking office but suspended proposed tariffs on Mexico.[15][16]

Critics of zero-tariff multilateral trade agreements from both ends of the political spectrum argue that these agreements erode national sovereignty and encourage a race to the bottom in wages, worker protections, and product quality and standards. Meanwhile, defenders of these agreements counter that tariffs lead to trade wars, harm consumers, and stifle innovation.

## What is the simple definition of tariffs?

A tariff is an additional fee that a country charges on imported goods.

## What are examples of tariffs?

One of the most famous examples of tariffs in U.S. history is the tea tax imposed by Britain on American colonies, which led to the Boston Tea Party.[17]

## How Do Tariffs Work?

As an additional charge on imported goods, tariffs function to divert buyers' intentions and funds away from the countries exporting those goods.

## Bottom Line

Tariffs have existed in some form for centuries. Trading partners implement tariffs to politically influence partners, protect domestic industries and consumers, and further achieve national goals and interests.

Regardless of what you see in the news, tariffs are not always negative. They can serve as a means to restart negotiations between trading partners, provide opportunities for both sides to express concerns, and even help stabilize a country's markets.
