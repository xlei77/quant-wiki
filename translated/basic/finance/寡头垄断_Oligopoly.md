## What is Oligopoly?

An oligopoly is a market structure where a small number of companies control the market. Under oligopolistic conditions, producers can indirectly or directly restrict output or prices to obtain higher returns. A key characteristic of oligopoly is that no single company can prevent other companies from having a significant impact on the market. Oligopoly differs from monopoly, where one company dominates the market.

### Key Points

- Oligopoly is a market structure where a small number of producers attempt to limit output or fix prices to obtain above-normal market returns.
- Economic, legal, and technological factors can contribute to the formation and maintenance, or dissolution, of oligopolies.
- The main difficulty faced by oligopolies is the prisoner's dilemma that each member faces, which encourages each member to cheat.
- Government policies can either prevent or encourage oligopolistic behavior, and companies in mixed economies often seek government blessing to limit competition.

## Understanding Oligopoly

Market structures come in different forms and sizes. The term is used to describe distinctions between industries that consist of different companies selling their products and services. Most market structures aim for perfect competition, which is a theoretical structure that doesn't actually exist.

These market structures consist of a small number of companies that control the market within an industry. Companies in an oligopoly set prices, either collectively (in cartels) or under the leadership of one company, rather than taking prices from the market. As a result, profit margins are higher than in more competitive markets.

Some entry barriers in oligopolies (which prevent new entrants from entering the market) include economies of scale, regulatory barriers, access to supply and distribution channels, capital requirements, and brand loyalty.

Historically, oligopolies have included steel manufacturers, oil companies, railroad companies, tire manufacturers, grocery store chains, and wireless carriers. The economic and legal concern is that oligopolies may block new entrants, slow innovation, and raise prices, all of which harm consumers.

## Special Considerations

Governments sometimes respond to oligopolies through laws against price manipulation and collusion. However, price manipulation can occur if cartels operate beyond government reach or with government blessing. Oligopolies existing in mixed economies frequently seek and lobby for favorable government policies to operate under regulatory oversight or even direct supervision of government agencies.

The main problem faced by companies in an oligopoly is that each company has an incentive to cheat. If all companies in an oligopoly agree to collectively limit supply and maintain high prices, each company has the potential to gain substantial business from others by breaking the agreement and undercutting other companies. This competition can occur through pricing, or simply through individual companies increasing their output to the market.

**Important Note:** Companies in oligopolies benefit from price manipulation, collectively setting prices, or setting prices under the guidance of one company, rather than relying on free market forces to do so.

## Characteristics of Oligopoly

Oligopolies are considered stable. One of the main reasons for their stability is that participating companies need to see that the benefits of cooperation outweigh the costs of economic competition, and then agree not to compete but rather to accept the benefits of cooperation.

These companies sometimes find creative ways to avoid price manipulation, such as using moon phases. Price manipulation refers to setting prices rather than letting them be determined by free market forces. Another approach is for companies to follow a recognized price leader, so that when the leader raises prices, other companies follow suit.

Conditions that enable oligopolies to exist include high entry costs in terms of capital expenditure, legal privileges (licenses to use radio spectrum or railway land), and platforms that gain value with more customers, such as social media.

Global technological and trade transformations have changed some of these conditions. For example, offshore production and the rise of mini-mills have affected the steel industry. In the office software applications sector, Microsoft (MSFT) became a target for Google Docs, with Google using cash from its web search business to fund Google Docs.

## Oligopoly and Game Theory

Game theorists have developed models for these scenarios, which constitute a form of prisoner's dilemma. When costs and benefits reach an equilibrium such that no company wants to leave the group, it is considered a Nash equilibrium state of oligopoly. This can be achieved through contracts or market conditions, legal restrictions, or strategic relationships between oligopoly members that can punish cheaters.

Maintaining an oligopoly and coordinating actions broadly between buyers and sellers in the market involves shaping various prisoner's dilemmas and the payoffs of related coordination games that repeat over time.

Thus, many of the same institutional factors that facilitate market economies by reducing prisoner's dilemma problems between market participants - such as secure contract enforcement, high-trust and reciprocal cultural conditions, and laissez-faire economic policies - may also help encourage and maintain oligopolies.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Oligopoly

One of the main benefits of having an oligopoly is that competition is very limited. This is because there are few participants in the market. Due to the small number of competitors, oligopolies allow participants to earn higher profits.

Oligopolies have higher entry barriers for new participants. This means that entering the market can be difficult due to high costs associated with conducting business, regulatory environment, and problems that arise when accessing supply and distribution channels.

Due to the lack of competition, there may be little incentive to innovate products and services. Because of the lack of product diversity, consumers remain loyal to the products they know best.

#### Advantages

- Limited competition
- Higher company profits
- Greater consumer demand

#### Disadvantages

- High entry barriers for new participants
- Lack of innovation
- Limited consumer choices

## Examples of Oligopoly

There are many examples of oligopolies in the market. However, one of the main examples of global oligopoly is the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The organization was established in Baghdad in 1960 with five initial countries, but expanded to 13 oil-producing countries by 1975.[1]

OPEC is considered one of the primary examples of oligopoly because it lacks overall authority. Each member country within the group also owns a significant portion of the group's market share. These countries also have substantial power in matters of supply and demand, as well as pricing (rather than having it individually). Therefore, when the group reduces supply during periods of decreased demand, prices rise. The opposite occurs when demand increases.

## What are the negative impacts of oligopoly?

An oligopoly refers to a market condition where a small number of companies exercise significant control over a specific market. These companies may collude with each other to control prices, ultimately offering non-competitive prices in the market. Other adverse effects of oligopoly include restricting new entrants from entering the market and reducing innovation. Oligopolies have been observed in the oil industry, railway companies, wireless carriers, and large tech companies.

## What are examples of current oligopolies?

One measure to determine if an oligopoly exists is the concentration ratio, which calculates a company's size relative to its industry. Examples of high concentration ratios include mass media. For instance, in the United States, the industry is dominated by just five companies: NBC Universal; Walt Disney; Time Warner; ViacomCBS; and News Corporation - even as streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime begin to encroach on this market. Meanwhile, in the big tech sector, two companies control smartphone operating systems: Google's Android and Apple's iOS.

## Is the US Airline Industry an Oligopoly?

As of 2021, just four companies control nearly two-thirds of domestic flights in the United States, leading to claims that the airline industry is an oligopoly. These four companies are Delta Air Lines, United Airlines Holdings, Southwest Airlines, and American Airlines. According to a report compiled by the White House, "reduced competition has led to increased fees for baggage and cancellations. These fees typically rise in lockstep, indicating a lack of meaningful competitive pressure, and are often hidden from consumers at the time of purchase."[2] Interestingly, the Airline Deregulation Act was passed in 1978, which stripped the Civil Aeronautics Board of its ability to regulate the industry.[3] Prior to this, the airline industry operated much like a utility, and ticket prices had been declining in the 20 years before deregulation was introduced.

## Bottom Line

Perfect competition does not exist in the market. However, there are different market structures, including oligopoly. These types of markets are characterized by a small number of participating companies, which may collectively set prices.
