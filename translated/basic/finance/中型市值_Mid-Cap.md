## What are Mid-Cap Companies?

Mid-capitalization (or mid-cap) is a term used to describe companies with market capitalizations between $2 billion and $10 billion. As the name suggests, mid-cap companies fall between large-cap and small-cap companies. The classifications of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap are approximate measures of a company's current value and can therefore change over time.

### Key Points

- Mid-cap refers to companies with market capitalizations between $2 billion and $10 billion.
- For companies, the appeal of mid-cap firms lies in their expected growth and increases in profits, market share, and productivity; they are in the middle stage of their growth curve.
- Mid-cap stocks play a unique role in portfolio diversification as they offer a balance between growth and stability.

## Understanding Mid-Cap

Companies primarily have two ways to raise capital when they need funding: through debt or equity. Debt needs to be repaid but can generally be borrowed at lower rates than equity (due to tax advantages). Equity costs may be higher but don't require repayment during crises. Therefore, companies seek to balance debt and equity, a balance known as the company's capital structure. Capital structure, particularly equity capital structure, can provide investors with important information about a company's growth prospects.

One way to understand a company's capital structure and market depth is to calculate market capitalization. Companies with lower market capitalization, also known as small-cap companies, have market capitalization of $2 billion or less. Large-cap companies have market capitalization exceeding $10 billion, while mid-cap companies fall between these two (market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion). For clarity, market capitalization classifications have been expanded to include mega-cap (over $200 billion), micro-cap ($50 million to $500 million), and nano-cap (below $50 million).

Mid-cap companies can be attractive to investors because they are expected to grow and improve their profits, market share, and productivity; they are in their growth phase. Since they are still viewed as being in a growth phase, they are considered less risky than small-cap companies but riskier than large-cap companies. Successful mid-cap companies face the risk of rising market capitalization, primarily due to stock price increases, moving them out of the "mid-cap" category.

Although a company's market value depends on market price, a stock trading above $10 per share is not necessarily a mid-cap stock. When calculating market capitalization, analysts multiply the current market price by the current number of outstanding shares. For example, if Company A has 10 billion outstanding shares at $1 per share, its market capitalization is $10 billion. If Company B has 1 billion outstanding shares at $5 per share, its market capitalization is $5 billion. Despite Company A's lower share price, its market capitalization is higher than Company B's. Although Company B has a higher share price, its number of outstanding shares is only one-tenth of Company A's.

## Advantages of Mid-Cap Stocks

Most financial advisors suggest that the key to reducing risk lies in building a diversified portfolio; investors should own a combination of small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks. However, some investors also view mid-cap stocks as a way to diversify risk. Small-cap stocks offer the greatest growth potential but come with the highest risk. Large-cap stocks provide the greatest stability but have relatively lower growth prospects. Mid-cap stocks represent a hybrid of the two, offering a balance between growth and stability.

No one can accurately predict when the market will favor a particular type of company, whether large-, mid-, or small-cap. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, it's important to diversify your portfolio. But the proportion of mid-cap stocks you want to invest in depends on your specific goals and risk tolerance.

However, mid-cap companies have several advantages that investors can consider. When interest rates are low and capital is cheap, company growth tends to be more stable. Mid-cap companies typically can access the credit they need for growth and perform well during the expansion phase of business cycles.

Mid-cap stocks carry lower risk than small-cap companies, meaning they perform relatively well during periods of economic turbulence. Additionally, many mid-cap companies have better name recognition and typically focus on a specific area and have existed long enough to establish a niche in their target market. Finally, because their risk is higher than large-cap companies, they may offer higher returns, which might be more attractive to less risk-averse investors.

Investors can either directly purchase stocks in mid-cap companies or invest in mid-cap funds that focus on mid-cap companies as an investment vehicle.
