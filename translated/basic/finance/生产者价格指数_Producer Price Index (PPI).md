## What is the Producer Price Index (PPI)?

The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the average change over time in the prices domestic producers receive for their output. It is an indicator of wholesale-level inflation, consisting of thousands of indexes that measure producer prices by industry and product category. The index is published monthly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

PPI differs from the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices paid by consumers for goods and services.

### Key Points

- The Producer Price Index measures price changes paid to U.S. producers of goods and services.
- PPI is an indicator of wholesale inflation, while the Consumer Price Index measures prices paid by consumers.
- The index is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
- PPI indices are calculated based on products and services, industries, and buyers' economic identities, which are used to calculate the overall monthly changes in the final demand PPI.
- These indices calculate price changes in private contracts based on supplier input prices.

## Understanding the Producer Price Index (PPI)

PPI measures inflation (or rarely, deflation) from the perspective of product manufacturers or service providers. Price trends between producers and consumers are unlikely to diverge long-term, as producer prices largely influence the prices charged to consumers, and vice versa. In the short term, inflation at wholesale and retail levels may differ due to distribution costs, government taxes, and subsidies.[1]

The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the PPI and its constituent industry and product indices in the second week following the survey reference date. It is based on approximately 100,000 monthly price quotations voluntarily reported online by over 25,000 systematically sampled producer establishments.[2][3]

**2.2%:** The unadjusted PPI reading for the 12 months ending April 2024. The final demand index increased 0.5% in April compared to March.[4]

The survey covers all goods output and approximately 69% of service value in the United States. Its component product and service indices are weighted according to the value of output in that category to calculate the overall change in producer prices.[5]

The PPI is used to forecast inflation and calculate automatic adjustment clauses in private contracts based on the prices of key inputs. It is also crucial for tracking industry price changes and comparing wholesale and retail price trends.[5]

## Producer Price Index (PPI) vs. Consumer Price Index (CPI)

PPI and CPI are both important economic indicators as they point to monthly price changes. However, they reflect prices from different perspectives. As mentioned above, PPI measures prices based on the first commercial transaction of products or services.[5]

This contrasts with the Consumer Price Index, which measures price changes encountered by consumers.[6]

CPI focuses on final sales. But these two indices differ not only in the types of prices they measure. There are also important compositional differences between PPI and CPI to consider. These distinctions are based on what is included and excluded in each index.

**Important Note:** Before 1978, PPI was known as the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). In 1982, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reset the base for all producer price indices to 100.[7]

For example, PPI does not measure price changes in overall housing costs, while CPI's housing category (including imputed owners' equivalent rent) accounts for one-third of the total index.

Meanwhile, PPI includes a healthcare services weight of nearly 16.6%, not far from the industry's nearly 20% weight in U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In contrast, healthcare's weight in CPI is 8%. This is because it does not measure third-party healthcare reimbursements.[8][9]

Another key difference is that, unlike CPI, PPI does not include prices for imported goods. Conversely, PPI includes export prices, while CPI does not.[10]

## Producer Price Index (PPI) Data Presentation

The Bureau of Labor Statistics generates over 10,000 product and industry price indices monthly, which are then used to calculate the PPI. These are published in both seasonally adjusted and unadjusted forms, and are divided into three categories: Industry-level Classification, Commodity Classification, and Final Demand-Intermediate Demand.[11]

The PPI includes producer price indices received in more than 500 industry categories, based on output sold outside the industry. These categories are compatible with categories used in other publications for reporting industry-level data on production, employment, earnings, and productivity.[11]

The commodity classification ignores the producer's industry and instead groups output according to the nature of the product or service. The PPI report publishes over 3,800 commodity price indices for goods and approximately 900 for services.[11]

The Final Demand-Intermediate Demand indices use commodity indices organized by product to measure producer prices based on the economic identity of the buyer and whether the goods sold require further processing.

The PPI report publishes more than 600 FD-ID indices. The Final Demand indices (as distinct from Intermediate Demand indices) are then used to derive the headline PPI figure, which reflects the PPI for final demand.[11]

## What is included in the Producer Price Index?

The Producer Price Index "measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. The prices included in the PPI come from the first commercial transaction for many products and some services."[5]

## What is the difference between Producer Price Index and Consumer Price Index?

Both CPI and PPI measure inflation. PPI measures inflation from the producers' perspective; the average selling price of output they receive over a period of time. CPI measures inflation from the consumers' perspective; the value of a basket of goods and services purchased by consumers over a period of time.[10]

## What Does the Producer Price Index Predict?

The Producer Price Index views inflation from the perspective of industries and businesses. This approach measures price changes before consumers purchase final goods and services. Therefore, many analysts believe it can predict inflation before it appears in the CPI.

## Conclusion

The Producer Price Index measures the price changes received by domestic producers for their goods and services. This index serves as an indicator of wholesale inflation and a measure of economic health.
