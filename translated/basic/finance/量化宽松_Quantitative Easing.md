## What is Quantitative Easing?

Quantitative Easing (QE) is a form of monetary policy adopted by central banks (such as the Federal Reserve System) that involves purchasing securities in the open market to lower interest rates and increase the money supply.

Quantitative Easing creates new bank reserves, providing banks with more liquidity, which in turn encourages lending and investment. In the United States, the Federal Reserve System implements QE policies.

### Key Points

- Quantitative easing is a monetary policy used by central banks to increase domestic money supply and stimulate economic activity.
- Under QE policy, central banks purchase government bonds and other financial instruments, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
- Quantitative easing is typically implemented when interest rates are near zero and economic growth is stagnant.
- In the United States, the Federal Reserve System implements quantitative easing policies.

## Understanding Quantitative Easing

Quantitative easing is typically implemented when interest rates are near zero and economic growth has stalled. Central banks have limited monetary policy tools, such as lowering interest rates, to influence economic growth. When further interest rate reductions are no longer possible, central banks must respond by strategically increasing the money supply.

To execute quantitative easing, central banks purchase government bonds and other securities, injecting bank reserves into the economy. This process of increasing the money supply provides liquidity to the banking system and further reduces interest rates, enabling banks to lend more freely.

Fiscal policy may be implemented simultaneously by the government to expand the money supply. While the Federal Reserve can influence the money supply in the economy, the U.S. Treasury can create new money through fiscal policy and implement new tax policies to inject funds into the economy either directly or indirectly.

Quantitative easing can combine both monetary and fiscal policies.

## Is Quantitative Easing Effective?

Most economists believe that the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing programs helped save the U.S. and global economy following the 2007-2008 financial crisis; however, the effects of QE are difficult to quantify.

Globally, central banks have also attempted to avoid recession and deflation through quantitative easing, but the results have been similarly mixed. While QE policies have been effective in lowering interest rates and boosting stock markets, their broader impact on the overall economy remains unclear.

According to Stephen Williamson, former economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, quantitative easing typically benefits borrowers while harming savers and non-investors, thus QE has both advantages and disadvantages.[1]

**Note:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, quantitative easing was implemented, with the Federal Reserve System increasing its asset holdings until the first quarter of 2021, when its holdings of fiscal securities reached 56% of issuance.[2]

## Risks of Quantitative Easing

As money is injected into the economy, inflation risks emerge. Although liquidity gradually transmits through the system, central banks must remain vigilant, as there is typically a 12-to-18-month time lag between increases in money supply and inflation rates.[4]

If quantitative easing fails to stimulate the expected economic growth and instead leads to inflation, people may face stagflation, where both inflation rates and unemployment rates remain high.

Although liquidity increases for banks, central banks like the Federal Reserve cannot force banks to increase lending, much less compel individuals and businesses to borrow and invest. This can result in a credit crunch, where cash is either held by banks or hoarded by businesses due to uncertain business conditions.[5]

With the increase in money supply, quantitative easing may lead to depreciation of the domestic currency. While a depreciated currency helps domestic manufacturers by making their exported goods cheaper in global markets, the falling currency value makes imports more expensive, thereby increasing production costs and consumer price levels.

## Practical Cases of Quantitative Easing

To address the Great Recession, the U.S. Federal Reserve System implemented quantitative easing programs from 2009 to 2014. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet expanded due to holdings in bonds, mortgages, and other assets. By 2017, U.S. bank reserves exceeded $4 trillion, providing liquidity to support lending and stimulate economic growth. However, banks held unexpectedly high excess reserves of $2.8 trillion, an unintended consequence of the Federal Reserve's QE program.[6]

In 2020, facing economic and market turmoil from COVID-19 lockdowns, the Fed announced plans to purchase $700 billion in assets as an emergency QE measure.[7] However, in 2022, the Federal Reserve System significantly adjusted its monetary policy, including substantial interest rate increases and reduction in asset holdings, to address persistent high inflation that emerged in 2021.[8]

After the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Japan entered a recession. The Bank of Japan initiated an aggressive quantitative easing program to combat deflation and stimulate the economy, moving from purchasing Japanese government bonds to private debt and stocks. The impact of this quantitative easing was only temporary; while Japan's GDP increased from $4.1 trillion in 1998 to $6.27 trillion in 2012, it fell back to $4.44 trillion by 2015.[9][10]

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) also adopted quantitative easing strategies after the 2008 financial crisis, with SNB's total assets exceeding the country's annual economic output. Although economic growth was promoted, the subsequent recovery's relationship to SNB's quantitative easing program remained unclear.[11][12]

In August 2016, the Bank of England (BoE) launched a quantitative easing program to address potential economic impacts of Brexit. The plan involved purchasing £60 billion in government bonds and £10 billion in corporate debt to prevent interest rate increases and stimulate business investment and employment.[13]

By June 2018, the UK Office for National Statistics reported that the quarterly compound average growth rate of gross fixed capital formation over the past decade was 0.2%, but 0.8% when excluding economic downturns, compared to 0.6% in the previous decade.[14]

British economists could not determine whether growth rates would have been significantly different without this quantitative easing program.[15]

## How Does Quantitative Easing Work?

Quantitative easing is a monetary policy where a country's central bank attempts to increase liquidity in the financial system by purchasing long-term government bonds from major banks, and stimulate economic growth by encouraging banks to lend or invest more freely.

## Is Quantitative Easing Money Printing?

Critics argue that quantitative easing is effectively a form of money printing, pointing to historical examples where money printing led to hyperinflation.[16] However, supporters of quantitative easing contend that since banks act as intermediaries, rather than cash being placed directly into the hands of individuals and businesses, there is less risk of quantitative easing causing uncontrolled inflation.[1]

## How Does Quantitative Easing Increase Bank Lending?

QE increases the money supply by replacing bonds with cash in the banking system, making it easier for banks to free up capital. As a result, they can underwrite more loans and purchase other assets.

## Conclusion

Quantitative Easing (QE) is a monetary policy implemented by central banks (such as the U.S. Federal Reserve System) that involves purchasing securities through open market operations to increase the money supply and promote bank lending and investment. While QE policies have been implemented globally, their impact on national economies often remains controversial.
