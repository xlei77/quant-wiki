## What is a Treasury Note?

A Treasury Note (T-note) is a tradable U.S. government debt security with a fixed interest rate and a maturity period ranging from two to ten years.

Treasury notes offered by the government can be purchased through competitive or non-competitive bidding. In competitive bidding, investors must specify their desired yield, but this also means they risk their bid not being accepted; non-competitive bidding, on the other hand, means investors accept the yield determined at auction.

### Key Points

- Treasury notes are U.S. government debt securities with fixed interest rates and maturities ranging from two to ten years.
- Treasury notes can be acquired through competitive bidding (where investors specify the yield) or non-competitive bidding (where investors accept a determined yield).
- Treasury notes are similar to Treasury bonds, with the only difference being their maturity periodsâ€”Treasury bonds have terms of 20 to 30 years.

## Understanding Treasury Notes

Treasury notes come with maturities of two, three, five, seven, and ten years, making them popular investment instruments with a large secondary market that enhances their liquidity.

Interest payments on Treasury notes are made semi-annually until maturity. Interest income is tax-exempt at the local or state level but remains taxable at the federal level, similar to Treasury bonds or Treasury bills.

Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and Treasury bills are all debt investments issued by the U.S. Treasury. The main difference between them lies in their maturity periods. Treasury bonds, for example, have maturities exceeding 10 years, up to 30 years, representing the longest-term sovereign fixed-income securities.

## Treasury Bills and Interest Rate Risk

The longer the maturity of a Treasury bill, the higher its exposure to interest rate risk. Beyond credit strength, the value of Treasury bills or bonds is affected by their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Interest rate changes are typically under the control of central banks or manifest as changes in the shape of the yield curve.

Moreover, these fixed-income instruments have different sensitivities to interest rate changes, meaning they experience varying degrees of price decline. Interest rate sensitivity is measured by duration, expressed in years. Factors used to calculate duration include coupon rate, yield, present value, final maturity, and redemption features.

An example of an absolute interest rate change occurred in December 2015, when the Federal Reserve (Fed) raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. At the time, rates were between 0% and 0.25%, and were subsequently adjusted to between 0.25% and 0%. The rise in the benchmark rate caused prices of all existing U.S. Treasury bills and bonds to fall.

## Special Considerations

Beyond the benchmark interest rate, changes in investor expectations can also lead to fluctuations in the yield curve, known as yield curve risk. This risk is related to the steepness or flatness of the yield curve and reflects changes in yields between similar bonds with different maturities.

For example, when the yield curve steepens, the gap between short-term and long-term rates widens, with long-term rates rising more than short-term rates. If short-term rates exceed any long-term rates, it creates a condition known as yield curve inversion.

Consequently, the prices of long-term Treasury securities decline relative to short-term Treasury securities. Conversely, when the yield curve flattens, the gap narrows, and the prices of short-term Treasury securities decline relative to long-term Treasury securities.
