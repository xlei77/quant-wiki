## What is Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)?

Compound Annual Growth Rate refers to the annual rate of return an investment needs to achieve in order to grow from an initial balance to a final balance over a given time interval. CAGR assumes that all profits are reinvested at the end of each period throughout the investment's lifecycle.

### Key Points

- Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is one of the most accurate methods for calculating and measuring returns on any investment that can increase or decrease in value over time.
- It measures the smoothed rate of return.
- Investors can compare the CAGRs of two or more investments to evaluate how a stock performs among its peers or against market indices.
- Therefore, CAGR is a good method for evaluating different investments' performance over time or relative to a benchmark.
- It's important to note that CAGR does not reflect investment risk.

## How to Calculate Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

$$ \begin{aligned}&CAGR=\left(\left(\frac{EV}{BV}\right)^{\frac1n}-1\right)\times100\\&\textbf{其中:}\\&EV=\text{结束值}\\&BV=\text{初始值}\\&n=\text{年数}\end{aligned} $$

To calculate the CAGR of an investment:

The CAGR formula provides an annualized rate of return, which is very useful for comparing the performance of different investments over time.

## What CAGR Can Tell You

The Compound Annual Growth Rate is not a real rate of return, but rather a representative figure. It essentially describes how fast an investment would grow if it increased at the same rate each year and profits were reinvested at the end of each year. For stock market investors, this is particularly useful for comparing the performance of different stocks. CAGR does not take into account the discount rate, which is crucial when evaluating the present value of future returns.

In reality, such consistent performance is unlikely to occur. However, CAGR can be used to smooth out returns, making them easier to understand and compare with other methods.

## Examples of CAGR Usage

Suppose you invested in a portfolio with $10,000，回报情况如下：

- 从2018年1月1日到2019年1月1日，投资组合增长至 $13,000 (30% growth in the first year).
- On January 1, 2020, the portfolio value was $14,000（从2019年1月到2020年1月增长7.69%）。
- 在2021年1月1日，投资组合价值 $19,000 (35.71% growth from January 2020 to January 2021).

We can see that the annual growth rates of the portfolio vary significantly when calculated yearly, as shown in parentheses.

On the other hand, the Compound Annual Growth Rate smooths out the investment performance, ignoring the huge differences between 2018 and 2020 versus 2019. The CAGR during this period was 23.86%, which can be calculated using the following formula:

$$ CAGR=\left(\frac{\$19,000}{\$10,000}\right )^{\frac{1}{3}}-1\times100=23.86\% $$

The 23.86% CAGR over the three-year investment period helps investors compare different investment options or predict future values. For example, suppose an investor is comparing the performance of two unrelated investments.

During any given year in this period, one investment might grow while the other might decline. This could happen when comparing high-yield bonds with stocks, or real estate investments with emerging markets. Using CAGR smooths out the annual returns over the entire period, making the two options easier to compare.

As another example, suppose an investor bought shares at $1,180 购买了55股亚马逊（AMZN）股票，总投资为 $64,900 per share in December 2017. Three years later, by December 2020, the share price rose to $3,200，投资者的投资现在价值 $176,000 per share. [1] What is the CAGR?

Using the CAGR formula, we know we need:

- Ending balance: $176,000
- 初始余额：$64,900
- Number of years: 3

Therefore, to calculate the CAGR for this simple example, we input the data into the formula as follows: [($176,000 / $64,900) ^ (1/3)] - 1 = 39.5%.

## Other Uses of CAGR

CAGR can be used to calculate the average growth rate of individual investments. As we saw in the example above, due to market volatility, the annual growth rate of investments may appear unstable and uneven.

For example, an investment might grow by 8% in one year, decline by -2% the following year, and then grow by 5% the next. CAGR helps smooth out returns when expected growth rates are volatile and inconsistent.

The geometric average produced by CAGR can be used to compare different types of investments. For instance, suppose in 2015, an investor put $10,000 投入一个为期五年的账户，年利率为1%，并将另 $10,000 into a stock mutual fund. The stock fund's returns would be uneven over the following years, making it difficult to compare these two investments.

Suppose at the end of five years, the savings account balance was $10,510.10，而尽管另一项投资的增长不均匀，股票基金的结束余额却是 $15,348.52. Using CAGR to compare these two investments can help investors understand the difference between returns:

$10,000，回报情况如下：

- 从2018年1月1日到2019年1月1日，投资组合增长至 $0

and:

$10,000，回报情况如下：

- 从2018年1月1日到2019年1月1日，投资组合增长至 $1

On the surface, the stock fund appears to be the better investment, with returns almost nine times that of the savings account. On the other hand, one drawback of CAGR is that by smoothing returns, CAGR cannot tell investors how volatile or risky the stock fund is. However, CAGR can be used in the MAR ratio to adjust for risk. Combining CAGR with metrics like Net Present Value (NPV) can provide a more comprehensive understanding of an investment's potential.

CAGR can also be used to track the performance of various business metrics for one or more companies. For example, over a five-year period, Big Sales Store's market share CAGR was 1.82%, but its customer satisfaction CAGR was -0.58% during the same period. In this way, comparing CAGR across different metrics within a company can reveal respective strengths and weaknesses.

Comparing CAGR of business activities among similar companies will help evaluate competitive advantages and disadvantages. For instance, Big Sales' customer satisfaction CAGR might be much better compared to Super Express Cable's customer satisfaction CAGR of -6.31% during the same period.

## How Investors Use CAGR

Understanding the formula used to calculate CAGR serves as a gateway to many other methods investors use to evaluate past returns or estimate future profits. The formula can be algebraically manipulated into formulas for calculating present or future value of money, or for calculating minimum hurdle rates of return.

For example, suppose an investor knows they need $215,000 available for investment. What average rate of return would they need to achieve this goal? The CAGR calculation can be used to find the answer to this question, as shown below:

$10,000，回报情况如下：

- 从2018年1月1日到2019年1月1日，投资组合增长至 $3

This version of the CAGR formula is simply a rearranged present value and future value equation. For example, if an investor knows they need $410,000, and on September 9, 2018, with $10,000，回报情况如下：

- 从2018年1月1日到2019年1月1日，投资组合增长至 $5$10,000，回报情况如下：

- 从2018年1月1日到2019年1月1日，投资组合增长至 $6 16,897.14}{\$10,000，回报情况如下：

- 从2018年1月1日到2019年1月1日，投资组合增长至 $7$10,000，回报情况如下：

- 从2018年1月1日到2019年1月1日，投资组合增长至 $8100,000, in 2017 it was $44,000, and in 2019 it was $126,000. If a fund manager claims in 2021 that their CAGR reached an impressive 42.01% over the past three years, this might technically be correct. However, they would be omitting some important information, such as the fact that the fund's CAGR over the past five years was only 4.73%.

## CAGR and IRR

CAGR measures the return on an investment over a specific period. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) also measures investment performance but is more flexible than CAGR.

The most important distinction is that CAGR is relatively simple and can be calculated manually. In contrast, for more complex investments and projects, or investments with numerous cash inflows and outflows, it's better to use IRR for evaluation. The best tools for using IRR include financial calculators, Excel, or portfolio accounting systems.

## What is an example of Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)?

CAGR is a measurement tool used by investors to calculate the growth rate of a quantity over time. The word "compound" indicates that CAGR takes into account the effects of compounding or reinvestment over time. For example, suppose you have a company whose revenue grows from $3 million to $30 million over a 10-year period. In this case, the CAGR is approximately 25.89%.

## What is the difference between CAGR and Growth Rate?

The main difference between CAGR and growth rate is that CAGR assumes the growth rate "repeats" or "compounds" each year, while traditional growth rate does not. Many investors prefer using CAGR because it smooths out the volatility of annual growth rates. For example, even highly successful companies with excellent performance may still experience several underperforming years during their development. These poor years may significantly impact individual annual growth rates, but have relatively little effect on the company's CAGR.

## Can CAGR Be Negative?

Yes. A negative CAGR represents a loss over time, rather than a gain.

## What is Risk-Adjusted CAGR?

To compare performance and risk characteristics between various investment options, investors can use risk-adjusted CAGR. A simple method to calculate risk-adjusted CAGR is to multiply CAGR by (1 - standard deviation) of the investment. If the standard deviation (i.e., risk) is zero, the risk-adjusted CAGR remains unaffected. The larger the standard deviation, the lower the risk-adjusted CAGR.

## Summary

CAGR is a valuable metric for investors to evaluate their investment performance over time. By smoothing annual returns, it provides a clearer view of an investment's growth trajectory. However, while CAGR can help compare different investments and forecast future values, it does not account for volatility or risk. Investors should use CAGR in conjunction with other metrics to make informed decisions, while understanding its limitations in reflecting the complete picture of investment performance.
