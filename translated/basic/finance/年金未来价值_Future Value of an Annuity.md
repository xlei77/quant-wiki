## What is the Future Value of an Annuity?

The future value of an annuity refers to the amount obtained by calculating a series of periodic payments at a specific rate of return or discount rate at a particular date in the future. The higher the discount rate, the greater the future value of the annuity. The future value of an annuity can be calculated as long as all annuity-related variables (such as payment amount, expected rate of return, and payment term) are known.

### Key Points

- The future value of an annuity is a method of calculating the value of a series of payments at a future point in time.
- In contrast, the present value of an annuity measures the amount needed to generate a series of future payments.
- In ordinary annuities, payments are made at the end of each agreed period; in annuities due, payments are made at the beginning of each period.[1]
- To calculate the future value of an annuity, one must know the payment amount, payment duration, and expected rate of return.
- Since payments in annuities due typically have an additional compounding period, their future value is usually higher than that of ordinary annuities.

## Understanding the Future Value of Annuities

Due to the time value of money, funds received or paid today are worth more than the same amount of funds in the future. This is because funds can be invested and grow over time. Following the same logic, a one-time payment of $5,000 today is worth more than the sum of five annual annuity payments of $1,000 spread over five years.

## Formula for Calculating the Future Value of an Annuity

The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is as follows. (An ordinary annuity pays interest at the end of each specified period, while an annuity due pays at the beginning of the period.)

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{P} = \text{PMT} \times \frac { \big ( (1 + r) ^ n - 1 \big ) }{ r } \\ &\textbf{其中：} \\ &\text{P} = \text{年金现金流的未来价值} \\ &\text{PMT} = \text{每笔年金付额} \\ &r = \text{利率（也称为折现率）} \\ &n = \text{支付期限} \\ \end{aligned} $$

**Important Note:** Ordinary annuities are more common, but under otherwise identical conditions, annuities due typically have a higher future value.

## Future Value of Annuity Due

In an annuity due, payments are made at the beginning of each period. Therefore, the formula is slightly different. To calculate the future value of an annuity due, simply multiply the ordinary annuity formula by (1 + r):

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{P} = \text{PMT} \times \frac { \big ( (1 + r) ^ n - 1 \big ) }{ r } \times ( 1 + r ) \\ \end{aligned} $$

## Example of Future Value of an Annuity

Suppose someone decides to invest $125,000 annually for the next five years in an annuity with an expected compound annual return of 8%.

In this example, the series of payments is an ordinary annuity, with payments made at the end of each period. Using the formula mentioned above, the expected future value is:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{未来价值} &= \$125,000 \times \frac { \big ( ( 1 + 0.08 ) ^ 5 - 1 \big ) }{ 0.08 } \\ &= \$733,325 \\ \end{aligned} $$

## Future Value of Annuity Due

Using the same example as above, but with an annuity due. This means that each $125,000 payment is made at the beginning of each period. The future value is calculated as follows:

$$ \begin{aligned} \text{未来价值} &= \$125,000 \times \frac { \big ( ( 1 + 0.08 ) ^ 5 - 1 \big ) }{ 0.08 } \times ( 1 + 0.08 ) \\ &= \$791,991 \\ \end{aligned} $$

Under otherwise identical conditions, the future value of an annuity due is higher than that of an ordinary annuity because the funds have additional time to accumulate compound interest. In this example, the future value of the annuity due is $58,666 more than the ordinary annuity.

## What is the Future Value Factor?

When calculating future value, one component is known as the future value factor. The future value factor refers to the total growth of a single payment or a series of cash flows. For example, if the future value of $1,000 is $1,100, then the future value factor is 1.1. A future value factor of 1.0 means that the present value of this set of cash flows equals its value today.

## What is the difference between annuities and annuities due?

Annuity payments are typically made at the end of each period, while annuities due are paid at the beginning of each period. Although this may not seem like a significant distinction, there can be considerable differences between the two when considering the accumulation of interest.

## What is the relationship between Present Value and Future Value?

Present value and future value represent the forward-looking or retrospective value of an investment. There is a direct relationship between these two concepts because a series of cash flows with a future value also has a present value. For example, a present value of $1,000 today might be equivalent to a future value of $1,200 today.

Typically, investors and analysts will know one value and try to solve for the other. For instance, if you purchase a stock today for $100 with an annual return of 2%, you can calculate the future value of that stock. Or, if you want to have a future value of $10,000 next year for a car down payment, you can solve for its present value.

## Conclusion

An annuity is a series of payments made over a period of time, typically with equal amounts in each period. Investors can determine the future value of their annuity by considering the annuity amount, expected rate of return, and payment duration. Additionally, whether annuity payments are made at the beginning or end of each period will affect the calculation of its future value.
