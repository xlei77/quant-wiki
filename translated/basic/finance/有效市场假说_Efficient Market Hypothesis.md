## What is the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)?

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), also known as Efficient Market Theory, proposes that stock prices reflect all available information, and it is impossible to consistently generate excess returns.

According to EMH, stocks always trade at their fair value on exchanges, making it impossible for investors to purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks at inflated prices. Therefore, it is impossible for investors to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and the only way to obtain higher returns is to purchase riskier investments.

### Key Points

- The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) or theory posits that stock prices reflect all available information.
- EMH assumes that stocks trade at their fair market value on exchanges.
- EMH proponents believe investors should benefit through low-cost passive portfolios.
- EMH opponents argue that it's possible to beat the market and that stocks can deviate from their fair market value.

## Understanding the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)

Although EMH is a cornerstone of modern financial theory, it is highly controversial and frequently challenged. Believers maintain that attempting to find undervalued stocks or predict market trends through fundamental or technical analysis is futile.

Theoretically, neither technical analysis nor fundamental analysis can consistently generate risk-adjusted excess returns (alpha), and only insider information can achieve extraordinary risk-adjusted returns.

While academia points to substantial evidence supporting EMH, there are equally numerous objections. For instance, investors like Warren Buffett have consistently outperformed the market over long periods, which should be impossible under EMH.

EMH opponents also point to events such as the 1987 stock market crash, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 20% in a single day, and asset bubbles as evidence that stock prices can significantly deviate from their fair value.

**Important Note:** While the assumption of market efficiency is a cornerstone of modern financial economics, it has been challenged in practice.

## Special Considerations

Supporters of the Efficient Market Hypothesis believe that due to market randomness, investors may achieve better returns by investing in low-cost, passive portfolios.

Data compiled by Morningstar in their "Active/Passive Barometer Study" from June 2019 supports EMH. Morningstar compared the returns of active managers across categories with the aggregate returns of related index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The study found that over the 10 years beginning June 2009, only 23% of active managers outperformed their passive peers. Foreign stock funds and bond funds had higher success rates, while U.S. large-cap funds had lower success rates. Overall, investors performed better by investing in low-cost index funds or ETFs.

Although some active managers outperformed passive funds at certain points in time, the challenge for investors is identifying which managers can maintain this performance over the long term. More than 25% of high-performing active managers failed to consistently outperform their passive counterparts over time.

## What Does Market Efficiency Mean?

Market efficiency refers to the degree to which prices reflect all available information. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) suggests that markets are efficient, and therefore there is little room to achieve excess profits through investment, as all prices are already fairly and accurately reflected. This means that the hope of beating the market is minimal, although market returns can be matched through passive index investing.

## Is the Efficient Market Hypothesis Valid?

The validity of EMH has been questioned both theoretically and empirically. Some investors, like Warren Buffett, have outperformed the market by focusing on undervalued stocks, earning billions in returns and setting an example for numerous followers. There are also portfolio managers who perform better than their peers, and certain investment firms that have more prestigious reputations in research and analysis. However, EMH proponents argue that those who beat the market do so not because of skill but due to luck, following the laws of probability: in a market with many participants, some will inevitably perform above average while others perform below.

## Can Markets Be Inefficient?

Indeed, some markets can be less efficient than others. In an inefficient market, asset prices fail to accurately reflect their true value, which can occur for various reasons. Market inefficiency may exist due to information asymmetry, insufficient buyers and sellers (i.e., low liquidity), high transaction costs or delays, market psychology, and human emotions. Inefficiency often leads to waste of resources. In reality, most markets do exhibit some degree of inefficiency, and in extreme cases, market inefficiency can manifest as market failure.

Accepting the pure (strong) form of EMH can be difficult, as it suggests that all information in the market, whether public or private, is already calculated into stock prices. However, EMH also exists in modified forms to reflect its applicability in markets:

- Semi-strong Efficiency: This form of EMH holds that all public (but not private) information is already calculated into current stock prices. Neither fundamental nor technical analysis can generate excess returns.
- Weak Efficiency: This form of EMH states that all historical price information is reflected in today's stock prices. Therefore, technical analysis cannot be used to predict and beat the market.

## How to Improve Market Efficiency?

The more market participants there are, the higher the market efficiency becomes, as more people compete and introduce more diverse types of information into prices. As markets become more active and liquid, arbitrageurs emerge who profit from correcting small inefficiencies, quickly restoring market efficiency.
