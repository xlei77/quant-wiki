## What is Marginal Benefit?

Marginal benefit is the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for an additional unit of goods or services. It also represents the additional satisfaction or utility that consumers obtain when purchasing additional goods or services. As consumption of a particular good or service increases, the consumer's marginal benefit tends to decrease.

In the business context, the producer's marginal benefit is typically referred to as marginal revenue.

### Key Points

- Marginal utility represents the maximum cost a consumer is willing to pay for an additional good or service.
- Marginal utility also indicates the incremental satisfaction gained by consumers when purchasing additional goods or services.
- Marginal utility typically decreases as consumption increases.
- The marginal utility of some necessities (such as medicines) does not decrease over time.
- Businesses can utilize their studies of marginal utility to find the optimal price point for transactions.

## Understanding Marginal Returns

Similar to marginal utility, marginal returns apply to any additional units purchased by consumers after obtaining the first unit. The term utility is used to describe the level of satisfaction that consumers attribute to the units consumed.

Marginal returns can be expressed either in terms of the amount consumers are willing to spend on additional units or in hypothetical units such as "utils." This assumes that consumers consider the amount paid to be equal to the minimum intrinsic value of the item.

For example, if someone purchases a hamburger for $10, it can be assumed that the perceived value the consumer derives from this item is at least $10. If they are willing to buy a second hamburger for $5 but not for $6, then the marginal return of the second hamburger must be between $5 and $6.

Not all products experience changes in perceived value. For instance, prescription medications maintain their utility as long as they continue to work as needed. Additionally, certain everyday items (such as bread or milk) maintain relatively consistent marginal returns over time.

## Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns

As unit consumption increases, the utility or satisfaction that consumers derive from consumption tends to decrease.

To illustrate this, consider the example above. Suppose a consumer wants to purchase an additional hamburger. If this consumer is willing to pay $10 for this additional hamburger, then the marginal benefit of consuming this hamburger equals the initial $10.

However, if the consumer decides they are only willing to pay $9 for the second hamburger, then the marginal benefit is $9. The more hamburgers consumers have, the less they are willing to pay for the next one. This is because benefits decrease as consumption quantity increases.

## Marginal Revenue Calculation Formula

Marginal revenue can be determined through the slope of the demand curve or using the following formula:

$$ \begin{aligned}\text{边际收益}=\frac{\text{总额外收益}}{\text{总消费的额外商品数量}}\end{aligned} $$

## Types of Marginal Utility

Marginal utility can have three possible value ranges.

Most goods have positive marginal utility, meaning consumers experience net benefits from each additional unit of consumption. Although marginal utility may decrease over time, consumers still feel increased benefits when consuming more.

Negative marginal utility means consumers feel worse when consuming additional units. For example, with alcohol consumption or unhealthy snacks, additional consumption leads to decreased satisfaction.

Goods with zero marginal utility refer to cases where consumers experience no change in satisfaction from additional consumption. This can occur when a product has qualities that simultaneously increase and decrease satisfaction, resulting in zero net utility.

## Marginal Returns and Unit Pricing

Although consumers may be willing to pay $10 for a hamburger, $10 is not necessarily the market price of the hamburger. Prices are determined by market forces. When the perceived value is higher than the market price, the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and the market price is called consumer surplus. This is different from economic surplus.

In cases where consumers perceive the value of a good to be lower than its market price, they may ultimately choose not to engage in the transaction.

## Enterprise Marginal Benefit

Marginal benefit has significant importance for enterprises, particularly in marketing and research. Companies need to consider that consumers may compare the marginal cost of additional purchases with their marginal benefits. Marginal cost is the additional cost incurred when producing subsequent units.

Returning to the example above, if a customer buys the first burger for $10 and the second for $9, they might assign a marginal benefit of $9 to the second burger and decide to purchase when the marginal cost is $9. However, if the customer feels full after eating just one burger, then the $9 marginal cost would exceed the benefit, leading them to stop purchasing.

Companies can use their research on marginal benefits to find the optimal price point for any transaction. Companies can also use this research to understand the additional expenses of selling a second item compared to the first.

## Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost

The concept of marginal cost is similar to marginal revenue, where the former represents the incremental cost incurred by a producer to create an additional unit of goods. Like marginal revenue, marginal cost typically decreases as the total number of units increases.

For example, imagine a hypothetical factory producing paper cups. The production process requires $1 million worth of equipment capable of producing up to 100,000 cups per day. Additionally, the manufacturing process requires $1 worth of paper and adhesive materials per cup.

If the factory currently produces fewer than 100,000 cups, the marginal cost for each additional cup is only $1. Fixed costs (such as equipment and facilities) are not included. However, if the factory is already operating at full capacity, the marginal cost of producing more cups could be significantly higher than $1, reflecting the cost of additional machinery or changes in production processes.

## How to Calculate Marginal Revenue?

Marginal revenue can be calculated using the slope of the demand curve. For example, if you want to know the marginal revenue of the nth unit of a product, you can obtain the slope of the demand curve at the point where current consumption equals n.

## The Significance of Marginal Revenue to Producers

For manufacturers and other suppliers, the marginal revenue of a product represents the incremental profit they can obtain by selling additional units of that product. This is not necessarily equal to the expected profit per individual unit. For example, if a company decides to sell an additional 1,000 bottles of soft drinks but expects half of them to remain unsold, the marginal revenue would be half the value of the per-unit profit.

## What is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns?

The Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns, also known as the Law of Diminishing Utility, states that the benefit derived from consuming a good decreases as consumption increases. Although each additional unit represents a net benefit to the consumer, this benefit is lower than the satisfaction obtained from previous consumption.

## Summary

Marginal utility represents one of the most fundamental concepts in microeconomics. It is the value or satisfaction that an economic agent derives from consuming an additional unit of a particular good. Marginal utility also determines how much consumers are willing to pay to obtain more consumption of a specific good.
