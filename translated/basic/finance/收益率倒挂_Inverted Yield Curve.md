An inverted yield curve indicates that long-term interest rates are lower than short-term rates. In an inverted yield curve, yields decrease as maturity approaches. The inverted curve, sometimes called a negative yield curve, has historically proven to be a reliable indicator of economic recession.

### Main Content

- The yield curve graphically represents the yields of similar bonds across different maturities.
- An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term debt instruments have higher yields than longer-term instruments of similar credit risk.
- An inverted yield curve is unusual; it reflects bond investors' expectations of declining long-term interest rates, which is typically associated with economic recession.
- Market participants and economists use various yield spreads as representations of the yield curve.

## Understanding the Inverted Yield Curve

The yield curve graphically represents the yields of similar bonds across different maturities. It is also known as the term structure of interest rates. For example, the U.S. Treasury publishes yields on Treasury bills and bonds daily, which can be plotted as a curve.[1]2

Analysts typically distill yield curve signals into spreads between two maturities. This simplifies the task of interpreting yield curves where inversions exist between some maturities but not others. The drawback is that there is no universal agreement on which spread is the most reliable indicator of economic recession.[3]

Typically, the yield curve slopes upward, reflecting the greater risks taken by holders of longer-term debt.

When long-term rates fall below short-term rates, the yield curve inverts, indicating that investors are shifting funds from short-term to long-term bonds. This suggests that the broader market has become more pessimistic about near-term economic prospects.

In modern times, such inversions have become relatively reliable indicators of economic recession.[4]5 Because yield curve inversions are relatively rare but typically occur before economic downturns, they usually receive close attention from financial market participants.

**Important Note:** An inverted Treasury yield curve is one of the most reliable leading indicators of economic recession.

## Choose Your Spread

Academic research on the relationship between inverted yield curves and economic recessions tends to focus on the spread between 10-year U.S. Treasury yields and 3-month Treasury bills, while market participants pay more attention to the yield spread between 10-year and 2-year bonds.[4]

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated in March 2022 that he prefers to measure recession risk by looking at the difference between current 3-month Treasury bill rates and derivatives market pricing for the same rate 18 months forward.[6]7

## Historical Examples of Inverted Yield Curves

Since a false positive in the mid-1960s, the 10-year/2-year Treasury spread has been a generally reliable indicator of economic recessions.[8] This hasn't stopped a long line of senior U.S. economic officials from underestimating its predictive power over the years.[9]

In 1998, the 10-year/2-year spread briefly inverted following Russia's debt default. The Federal Reserve quickly cut rates, helping to avoid a U.S. recession.

**Note:** While inverted yield curves have typically preceded economic recessions in recent decades, they don't cause recessions. Rather, bond prices reflect investors' expectations of lower long-term yields, which typically occur during recessions.

In 2006, the spread was inverted for most of the year. Long-term Treasuries outperformed stocks in 2007. The Great Recession began in December 2007.

On August 28, 2019, the 10-year/2-year spread briefly turned negative. The U.S. economy experienced a two-month recession in February and March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, which could not have been priced into bonds six months earlier.

In late 2022, the yield curve inverted again amid high inflation.

As of December 4, 2023, Treasury yields were as follows:

- 3-month Treasury yield: 4.31%
- 2-year Treasury yield: 4.56%
- 10-year Treasury yield: 4.22%
- 30-year Treasury yield: 4.40%10

As shown above, the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate is 0.26 percentage points lower than the 2-year yield. While the inverted yield curve has been narrowing since 2022, it remains inverted.

The state of the yield curve reflects investors' views on economic conditions and whether the Federal Reserve will continue raising rates. Or perhaps not.

Many economists believe the U.S. economy may still be heading toward a recession. However, some argue that as of December 2023, the narrowing of the inverted yield curve is telling a different story. Some say the yield curve might indicate investor confidence that skyrocketing inflation has been contained and normalcy will return, rather than signaling economic turmoil.

## What is the Yield Curve?

The yield curve is a line that plots the yields (interest rates) of bonds with the same credit quality but different maturities. The most widely watched yield curve is that of U.S. Treasury securities.

## What Can an Inverted Yield Curve Tell Investors?

Historically, prolonged inversions of the U.S. yield curve have been predictive of economic recessions. An inverted yield curve reflects investors' expectations that long-term interest rates will decline due to deteriorating economic performance.

## Why is the 10-Year vs 2-Year Spread So Important?

Many investors use the spread between 10-year and 2-year U.S. Treasury yields as a proxy for the yield curve, and it has been a relatively reliable leading indicator of economic recessions in recent decades. Some Federal Reserve officials believe that focusing on shorter-term maturities provides better insight into the likelihood of a recession.

## Bottom Line

Regardless of which yield spread you use as an indicator, a yield curve that remains inverted for a longer period appears to be a more reliable predictor of recession than one that inverts briefly.

Fortunately, recessions are rare events, and we don't have enough experience to draw definitive conclusions. As one Fed researcher noted, "Recessions are difficult to predict. We haven't experienced many recessions, and we don't fully understand the causes of the ones we have experienced. Nevertheless, we keep trying."3
