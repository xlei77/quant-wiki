## What is Hedging?

Hedging is an investment strategy aimed at reducing potential losses from other investments, as the prices of these investments typically move in opposite directions. This strategy acts like an insurance policy that can offset significant losses from other investments.

The term "hedging" is commonly used to describe diversifying an investment portfolio by purchasing conservative bond funds alongside stocks to offset potential losses from more volatile stock funds.

In financial markets, where traders constantly buy and sell assets, some of which are extremely risky, hedging typically involves derivatives trading, as derivatives have clearly defined relationships with their underlying assets, making them effective hedging instruments.

### Key Points

- Hedging is a strategy aimed at limiting or offsetting the risk of an investment or portfolio.
- A widely used hedging technique is purchasing derivatives.
- Portfolio diversification can also be considered a form of hedging. For example, buying cyclical and counter-cyclical stocks is one such instance.

## Principles of Hedging

Hedging works like buying insurance. If you own a property in a flood-prone area, you can protect it against flood risk by purchasing flood insurance - in other words, hedging. You cannot eliminate the risk of flooding, but you can mitigate potential financial losses.

Similarly, if you invest in a hot tech company and strongly believe its business will thrive in the coming quarters, you might also invest in a stable consumer goods company in case your judgment proves wrong.

## Disadvantages of Hedging

Hedging involves a trade-off between risk and return; while it reduces potential risks, it also diminishes potential returns.

Hedging is not free. In the example of flood insurance, monthly payments accumulate, and if a flood never occurs, the policyholder gets nothing in return. However, most people would still choose to limit their losses.

In professional investment, hedging operates in the same way. Investors and fund managers use hedging strategies to reduce and control their risk exposure. They utilize various tools, many of which are based on derivatives.

**Note:** A perfect hedge eliminates all risk from an investment position or portfolio. In other words, the hedge has a 100% negative correlation with the vulnerable asset. This is more of an ideal than a reality, and even a theoretically perfect hedge cannot avoid costs.

## Hedging Through Derivatives

Derivatives are financial contracts whose prices depend on the value of certain underlying securities. Futures, forward contracts, and option contracts are common types of derivative contracts.

The effectiveness of derivatives hedging is expressed through its delta value, sometimes called the hedge ratio. Delta refers to the magnitude of change in the underlying asset's price for every $1 change in the derivative's price.

Specific hedging strategies and the pricing of hedging instruments largely depend on the downside risk of the underlying security that investors wish to hedge. Generally, the greater the downside risk, the higher the cost of hedging.

Downside risk tends to increase with higher levels of volatility; longer-term options associated with volatile securities will be more expensive because they cost more as hedging instruments.

Typically, put options become more expensive with higher strike prices, but they also provide more price protection. These variables can be adjusted to create options that are lower in price but offer weaker protection, or options that are higher in price but provide greater protection.

**Note:** The term "hedge fund" derives from hedge fund managers' high degree of freedom in alternative investments and using risk strategies (such as leveraged investing).

## Example of Hedging with Put Options

In the investment world, hedging through put options is a common approach. A put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price on or before the expiration date.

For example, if Morty buys 100 shares of PLC stock at $10 per share, he might hedge his investment by purchasing a one-year put option with a strike price of $8. This option gives Morty the right to sell 100 shares of the stock at $8 within the next year.

Let's say he pays $1 for this option, or $100 in total option premium. If after one year the stock is trading at $12, Morty will choose not to exercise the option, thus losing $100. However, he might not be anxious about this as his unrealized gain would be $100 (including the option premium).

On the other hand, if the stock is trading at $0, Morty will exercise the option and sell his shares at $8, resulting in a loss of $300 (including the option premium). Without the option, he would have faced a total loss of his investment.

## Hedging Through Diversification

Strategically diversifying a portfolio to reduce certain risks can also be considered a form of hedging. For example, Rachel might invest in a luxury goods company with rising profits. However, she might worry that an economic recession would devastate the luxury consumer market. One way to address this concern is to purchase tobacco stocks or utility stocks, which typically remain stable during recessions and provide generous dividends.

This strategy has its trade-offs: when wages are high and jobs are plentiful, luxury goods manufacturers might thrive, but few investors are attracted to boring counter-cyclical stocks, which might decline as capital flows to more exciting sectors.

It also carries risks: luxury stocks and hedges don't necessarily move in opposite directions. They might both fall simultaneously due to a catastrophic event, as happened during the financial crisis.

## Bear Put Spread

For investors in index funds, moderate price declines are quite common and highly unpredictable. Investors focused on this area may be more concerned about moderate declines rather than severe drops. In such cases, a bear put spread is a common hedging strategy.

In this spread, the index investor purchases a put option with a higher strike price. Then, she sells a put option with a lower strike price but the same expiration date.

Depending on the index's performance, the investor thus receives price protection equal to the difference between the two strike prices (minus costs). Although this may only provide moderate protection, it is often sufficient to cover temporary declines in the index.

## Hedging and Everyday Investors

Most individual investors do not trade derivative contracts. Investors who adopt long-term strategies, such as those saving for retirement, can ignore daily market fluctuations.

For investors who follow a buy-and-hold strategy, there may seem to be little reason to learn about hedging. However, since large corporations and investment funds regularly engage in hedging operations, and these investors may be interested in or involved with these large financial entities, understanding hedging helps comprehend the behavior of these major market participants.

## What is Risk Hedging?

Hedging is a strategy to limit investment risk. Investors hedge by making trades in another investment that may move in the opposite direction.

## What are examples of hedging?

Hedging is commonly used to offset potential losses in foreign exchange trading. When forex traders predict currency fluctuations, they may take directly opposite positions to limit losses from price movements. This way, regardless of what happens, traders can preserve certain potential gains.

## Is Hedging an Imperfect Science?

Yes. A perfect hedge would eliminate all risks in an investment position or portfolio. In other words, the hedge would have a 100% negative correlation with the vulnerable asset. This is purely hypothetical, and even a theoretically perfect hedge comes with costs that reduce its returns.

## Conclusion

Hedging is an important financial concept that enables investors and traders to minimize various risk exposures. A hedge is essentially an offsetting or opposing position that appreciates (or depreciates) in correspondence with the depreciation (or appreciation) of the primary position.

Hedging can be viewed as an insurance policy for an investment or portfolio. These offsetting positions can be achieved through closely correlated assets or diversification.

Among professional traders, the most common and effective hedging methods involve the use of derivatives such as futures, forwards, or options contracts.
