## What is Gross Margin?

"Gross margin" is a financial metric used by analysts to evaluate a company's financial health. Gross margin refers to the profit after deducting the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).

Simply put, a company's gross margin is the profit earned after accounting for operating costs. This metric is typically expressed as a percentage of sales and may also be referred to as the gross margin ratio.

**Gross Profit vs. Gross Margin:** Gross profit is the total profit a company makes after deducting operating costs—that is, the company's total sales or revenue minus its cost of goods sold. This figure is expressed in dollar value. Gross margin is the profit earned by the company, expressed as a percentage.

### Key Points

- Gross margin is an analytical indicator that represents a company's net sales minus cost of goods sold.
- Gross margin is typically expressed as a percentage of gross profit relative to net sales.
- Gross margin shows the profit amount before deducting selling, general and administrative expenses, while net profit margin is calculated after deducting these expenses.

## Gross Margin Formula and Calculation

A company's gross margin is calculated using the following formula:

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{毛利率}=\frac{\text{净销售额 }-\text{ 销售成本}}{\text{净销售额}}\\ \end{aligned} $$

This requires first subtracting the cost of goods sold from the company's net sales (total revenue minus returns, allowances, and discounts). Then divide this number by net sales to calculate the gross margin as a percentage.

**Note:** Analysts use a company's gross margin to compare its business model with those of competitors.

## How Gross Margin Works

Gross profit refers to the total profit a company earns after deducting operating costs. Simply put, gross profit is a company's total sales or revenue minus its cost of sales. This figure is expressed in dollar value. On the other hand, gross margin is the company's profit expressed as a percentage using the aforementioned formula.

It is one of the key metrics that analysts and investors focus on as it helps them determine whether a company is financially healthy. Companies can also use it to understand where improvements can be made through cost cutting and/or increasing sales. Sales and cost of sales can be found in a company's income statement. A higher gross margin is desirable, indicating that the company operates efficiently, while a lower gross margin suggests areas that need improvement.

Product pricing adjustments can affect gross margins. All else being equal, if a company sells its products at a premium, its gross margin will be higher. However, this can be a delicate balancing act, as fewer customers may purchase the product if it is priced too high. As a result, the company might lose market share.

Significant fluctuations in profit margins may indicate poor management and/or low product quality. However, these changes might be reasonable when comprehensive operational changes are being made. Therefore, any temporary fluctuations should not cause concern. For example, if a company automates certain supply chain formations, the initial investment may be high, but the ultimate cost of goods will decrease due to reduced labor costs associated with automation.

**Important Note:** It is important to compare gross margins of companies within the same industry. This way, you can determine which companies are leading and which ones are lagging.

## Gross Margin vs. Net Profit Margin vs. Operating Margin

Gross margin is one of the key profitability indicators that analysts and investors focus on. The other two are net profit margin and operating margin.

Net profit margin is also a crucial financial indicator that points to a company's financial health. Also known as net margin, it represents the amount of profit generated as a percentage of company revenue. Simply put, a company's net profit margin is the ratio of its net profit to revenue.

A company's management can use its net profit margin to identify areas of inefficiency and examine whether its current business model is effective.

You can calculate a company's net profit margin by subtracting the cost of sales, operating and other expenses, interest, and taxes from the company's revenue. Then divide that number by the total revenue for that period. To get the percentage, multiply the result by 100.

A company's operating margin or operating profit indicates how much profit it generates under its core operations while considering all operating expenses. This type of profit margin takes into account additional expenses such as interest and expenditures.

This metric is calculated by subtracting all costs of sales, operating expenses, depreciation, and amortization from the company's total revenue. Like gross margin and net profit margin, operating margin is also expressed as a percentage by multiplying the result by 100.

## Gross Margin Example

Suppose both ABC Company and XYZ Company produce widgets with identical characteristics and similar quality levels.

If ABC Company finds a way to manufacture its products at one-fifth of the cost, it will achieve a higher gross margin due to its reduced cost of sales. This gives ABC Company a competitive advantage in the market. However, to compensate for its loss in gross margin, XYZ Company takes the approach of doubling its product prices to increase revenue.

This strategy has a drawback: it may backfire if customers are deterred by the higher prices. In this case, XYZ Company loses both gross margin and market share.

## What Does Gross Margin Indicate?

A company's gross margin indicates the profit it generates after accounting for direct costs associated with operations. Simply put, it shows how well a company converts its sales into profit. Expressed as a percentage, it is revenue minus cost of goods sold, which includes labor and materials.

## What's the difference between high and low gross margins?

Companies strive for higher gross margins as they indicate greater profitability. When a company has higher profit margins, it suggests operational efficiency. As long as its operating expenses remain under control, it can maintain itself at this level.

On the other hand, lower gross margins are concerning. They affect the company's bottom line and suggest areas where improvements can be made.

## How Can Companies Improve Their Gross Margin?

Companies can improve their gross margin and thereby increase their profitability through multiple approaches. These include:

## Bottom Line

As an investor, you need to look at several key financial indicators so you can make informed decisions about companies to add to your portfolio. Start by looking at the gross profit margin of businesses you might be interested in. You can calculate this by subtracting the cost of sales from the company's revenue—both figures can be found in the income statement.

The higher the profit margin, the more profitable and efficient the company is. However, be sure to compare profit margins between companies within the same industry, as variables are similar.
