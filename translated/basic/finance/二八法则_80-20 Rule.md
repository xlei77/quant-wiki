## What is the 80-20 Rule?

The 80-20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, is a common concept that asserts that in any given situation, 80% of the results (or outputs) are caused by 20% of the causes (or inputs).

In business, the goal of the 80-20 rule is to identify the inputs that are likely to be most productive and prioritize them. For example, once managers identify the factors that are critical to the company's success, they should focus most of their energy on these factors.

Although the 80-20 rule is frequently used in business and economics, you can apply this concept to any field. Wealth distribution, personal finance, consumption habits, and even infidelity in personal relationships can all be subjects of the 80-20 rule.

### Key Points

- The 80-20 rule suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of causes.
- The 80-20 rule prioritizes the 20% of factors that produce the best results.
- One principle of the 80-20 rule is to identify an entity's best assets and utilize them effectively to create maximum value.
- This rule is a guideline rather than a strict mathematical law.
- People sometimes incorrectly conclude that if 20% of factors should be prioritized, then the other 80% can be ignored.

## How Does the 80-20 Rule Work?

The 80-20 rule can be viewed as a simple cause-and-effect relationship: 80% of results (outputs) come from 20% of causes (inputs). This rule is often used to point out that 80% of a company's revenue is generated by 20% of its customers.

From this perspective, it might be beneficial for companies to focus on the 20% of customers who contribute 80% of revenue and target their marketing specifically to them. By doing this, companies can retain these customers and acquire new customers with similar characteristics. However, the 80-20 rule has more fundamental implications.

The essence of the 80-20 rule is to identify an entity's best assets and effectively utilize them to create maximum value. For example, students should try to determine which parts of the textbook will be most beneficial for an upcoming exam and focus on these parts first. However, this doesn't mean that students should ignore other parts of the textbook.

People may not realize that the 80-20 rule is a guideline rather than a strict mathematical law. Furthermore, the percentages don't necessarily have to equal 100%. Inputs and outputs simply represent different units. The percentages of these units don't need to add up to 100%. What's important is the concept behind the rule.

There's another way the 80-20 rule is misunderstood. That is, if 20% of inputs are most important, then the other 80% of inputs must be unimportant. This is a logical fallacy. Even if deciding to prioritize 20% of inputs, the 80% of inputs can still be important.

**Important Note:** Business managers across all industries use the 80-20 rule to help narrow their focus and identify factors that cause the biggest problems in their departments and organizations.

## Background of the 80-20 Rule

The 80-20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, is applied in Pareto analysis. It was originally used in macroeconomics to describe wealth distribution in Italy at the beginning of the 20th century. It was proposed by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto in 1906, who is famous for his concept of Pareto efficiency.[1]

Pareto noticed that 20% of the pea pods in his garden contributed to 80% of the peas. Pareto extended this principle to macroeconomics, showing that 80% of Italy's wealth was owned by 20% of the population.

In the 1940s, Dr. Joseph Juran, a prominent figure in operations management, applied the 80-20 rule to quality control in business production.

He demonstrated that 80% of product defects were caused by 20% of the problems in production methods. By focusing on and reducing these 20% of production issues, businesses could improve their overall product quality. Juran referred to this phenomenon as the "vital few and trivial many."[2]

## Benefits of the 80-20 Rule

Although there is little scientific analysis that can prove or disprove the effectiveness of the 80-20 rule, there is abundant anecdotal evidence supporting that the rule is fundamentally valid, even if numerically imprecise.

Sales performance results across various industries demonstrate success through the application of the 80-20 rule. Furthermore, external consultants using Six Sigma and other management strategies have incorporated the 80-20 principle into their practices with positive results.

## Examples of the 80-20 Rule

Carla, a graduate student at Harvard University, was working on an assignment for her digital communications course. The project's goal was to create a blog and monitor its success over one semester.

Carla designed, created, and launched the website. Mid-semester, the professor evaluated the blogs. Although Carla's blog had gained some recognition, it generated the least traffic compared to her classmates' blogs.

Carla stumbled upon an article about the 80-20 rule. The article stated that you could apply this concept in any field. Thus, Carla began thinking about how she could apply the 80-20 rule to her blog project. She thought, "I've invested substantial time, technical ability, and writing expertise in building this blog. However, despite all this effort, I'm getting very little website traffic."

She now understood that even if content is excellent, it has almost no value if no one reads it. Carla deduced that perhaps her blog's marketing was a bigger issue than the blog itself.

To apply the 80-20 rule, Carla decided to allocate her 80% to all the work creating the blog, including its content. Her 20% would be represented by the choices of blog visitors.

Using web analytics, Carla closely monitored her blog's traffic. She asked herself:

- Which sources constitute the top 20% of my blog traffic?
- Who are the top 20% of the audience I want to reach?
- What characteristics does this audience share as a group?
- Can I afford to invest more resources and effort into satisfying my top 20% readers?
- In terms of content, which blog posts make up the top 20% of my best-performing topics?
- Can I improve these topics and get more engagement from my content than I currently do?

Carla analyzed the answers to these questions and edited her blog accordingly:

Notably, although her analysis did confirm that the blog's biggest problem was its marketing, Carla didn't neglect its content. She remembered the common fallacy cited in the article—that if 20% of input is most important, the other 80% must be unimportant—and didn't want to make this mistake. She knew it was necessary to address all aspects of the content.

By applying the 80-20 rule to her blog project, Carla better understood her audience and therefore more purposefully targeted her top 20% readers. She redesigned the blog's structure and content based on what she learned, and her website's traffic increased by more than 220%.

## What is the 80-20 Rule?

The 80-20 rule is a principle stating that 80% of results come from 20% of causes. It is used to identify the factors most responsible for success (typically in a business context), and then focus on these factors to improve outcomes. This rule can also be applied to situations beyond the business domain.

## What Does the 80-20 Rule Mean?

The essence of the 80-20 rule simply emphasizes the importance of focusing your energy on those aspects of business—or life, sports, musical performance, blogging, etc.—that bring you the best results. However, this doesn't mean people should ignore less successful areas. It's about prioritizing focus and tasks, and then addressing the issues that are exposed through this prioritization.

## How Do I Use the 80-20 Rule for Investing?

When building an investment portfolio, you can consider investing in the 20% of stocks in the S&P 500 index that contribute to 80% of the market's returns. Alternatively, you can create an 80-20 allocation: 80% of investments can be in lower-risk index funds, while 20% can be in growth funds. Of course, past performance does not necessarily correlate with future results. Therefore, be sure to monitor your portfolio's performance to understand whether the results align with your intentions and goals.
