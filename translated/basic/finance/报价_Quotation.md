## What is a Quote?

A quote refers to the most recent transaction price of a stock, bond, or any other asset. Additionally, most asset classes also quote bid and ask prices, which determine the final transaction price. The bid price is defined as the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for an asset, while the ask price is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept.

In normal trading conditions, stable and highly liquid assets typically record narrow bid-ask spreads. However, when systemic risks emerge, such as geopolitical events or broad market declines, these price pairs usually show deviation. The emergence of volatility and uncertainty leads to shaken supply and demand mechanisms, thereby affecting quotations.

### Key Points

- A quote represents the latest transaction price of any asset traded in the market.
- The definition of a quote also includes the high, low, opening, and closing values for a given day.
- Most asset classes quote both the ask price and the original bid price that determine the final transaction price.
- The bid price is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay, while the ask price is the lowest price a seller is willing to receive.
- Market volatility leads to changes in supply and demand mechanisms that affect quotes.

## How Quotes Work

For most asset classes, quotes present two pieces of information: the price an investor must pay to purchase an asset at a specific point in time (the lowest price quoted by sellers) and the price an investor could receive for selling the same asset at that same moment (the highest price quoted by potential buyers). The difference between these represents the liquidity cost borne by investors when trading assets, as they must buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price.

**Important Note:** When asset prices begin to fall, the market will experience parallel deviations in bid and ask prices. This widening spread can lead to reduced asset liquidity, making it difficult to execute trades during broad market fluctuations.

Quotes aren't limited to just bid and ask prices. They also include the day's high, low, opening, and closing values. Basic stock quotes highlight these key data points to provide context for the current trading day's volatility. The spread between opening and closing or between highs and lows often reflects ongoing trends. For example, dramatic changes between opening and closing prices can signal strong upward momentum and noteworthy trading opportunities.

## Types of Quotes

Most investors associate the term "quote" with stock prices, but many other asset classes similarly record quotes of their last traded prices.

For example, the fixed income market also quotes bid and ask prices for bonds during normal trading hours. In addition to the bid-ask spread, bond quotes show the asset's par value and yield to maturity.

Bonds have a par value of $1,000, and prices are quoted as a percentage of their par value, then converted to points. For instance, if a corporate bond is quoted at 97, this means it trades at 97% of its par value, making the actual cost to purchase the bond $970.

Par value, also known as nominal value or face value, is typically converted to a number and multiplied by 10 to determine the bond's cost. Par value is an investment term that represents the original value.

It typically refers to the value of a bond when it was first issued, usually $100 or $1,000. For example, suppose a bond is purchased for $100, and over time, its value increases to $125. Although the bond is worth $125, its par value remains $100. If the bond depreciates to $75, the par value in this case still remains $100.

Par value is important because it determines the bond's maturity value and the amount of interest the bond pays. This interest rate is typically referred to as the bond's coupon rate.

**Important Note:** While stock quotes may be the first and most important consideration when placing orders, traders typically use additional information, often technical indicators, before placing orders.

Futures contracts and commodities also use quotes to provide investors and the financial community with relevant information about the asset. Quotes are used in the same way as with other assets, with the difference being that futures contract buyers agree to purchase the asset at a predetermined price at a specific time in the future.

Many investors use futures contracts to hedge trades or speculate on market movements. Futures contracts and "futures" are the same thing, and investors typically use just the phrase "futures" when referring to futures contracts.

An example of a futures contract quote is when a trader buys an oil futures contract at $80 per barrel for one year. This means that at a time one year from the purchase date, the buyer is obligated to purchase the oil at $80 per barrel, and the seller is obligated to sell it to the buyer. One advantage of trading futures contracts is that traders don't need to deposit the full trading amount with their brokerage, but rather need to pay an initial margin.

## Quote Example

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a publicly traded company with extremely high trading volume. Due to AAPL stock's extremely high liquidity, trading is very simple, and the bid-ask spread is very narrow. For example, suppose AAPL's closing price is $165 per share. The trading range for the day might be between $161 and $167, but at the end of the trading day, it closes at $165.

During the trading day, some traders want to buy AAPL stock, while others want to sell. If at 10:30, AAPL is trading at $163, buyers will see the bid-ask spread, which in this example is $162.99 for the bid and $163.01 for the ask. This spread is very narrow, only two cents. The buyer then pays the ask price to the seller, the seller delivers the shares to the buyer, and the trade is complete.

Although bid and ask prices are fundamental elements of financial market trading, when people refer to a quote, they almost always mean the stock's last traded price. This is also the first number you see when researching a stock, and it's usually the largest number displayed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

## How to Read Stock Quotes?

You can read stock quotes from several different aspects. If you're only curious about the stock price, just look at the "quote." This is the price people refer to when discussing stock trading prices. If you're trading the stock, you can check the bid price to see how sellers are pricing the stock, or look at the ask price to see what buyers are willing to pay. There will always be a difference between these two numbers, and this is precisely where market traders make their profit.

## What is real-time stock quotation?

Real-time stock quotes are similar to other quotations, but are typically updated in real-time by advanced trading platforms. They are most commonly used by day traders who engage in high-frequency trading (HFT). However, some critics argue that this trading approach favors companies and individuals with the most powerful technology.

## What is a Nominal Quote?

A nominal quote refers to a hypothetical price at which a stock or other security might trade. These are used by traders as "what-if" scenarios to determine whether they should make trades in the future. They are often prefixed with "For Your Information (FYI)" or "For Valuation Only (FVO)." They contrast with current actual quotes, which are known as firm quotes.

## What is an Interdealer Quotation System?

An Interdealer Quotation System (IQS) is a system designed to organize quotes from broker and dealer firms. They exist to provide investors with accurate and relevant information. There are various interdealer quotation systems, each with its own specialization. For example, in the United States, NASDAQ, NASDAQ Small Cap Market, and its Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) platform are all integrated into a single interdealer quotation system.

## Summary

Finding a security quote is very simple, usually it's the first number you see. If you just want to know the stock price, this is sufficient. However, if you plan to trade, there are many other quote-related considerations, such as bid-ask spreads and execution conditions at the last trading time. Quotes are regularly updated by powerful technology, but even so, update speeds can vary across different trading platforms.
