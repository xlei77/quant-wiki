## What is Short Selling?

Short selling is a trading strategy through which investors speculate on falling stock prices. Short sellers bet on and profit from the decline in security prices. Traders use short selling as a speculative tool, while investors or portfolio managers may use it as a hedging instrument to protect against downside risk in their long positions.

### Key Points

- Short selling refers to when investors borrow securities and sell them in the open market, planning to buy them back later at a lower price.
- Short sellers bet on and profit from the decline in security prices.
- Short selling has a high risk/reward ratio, offering potential for substantial profits, but losses can escalate quickly and may result in margin calls.

## How Short Selling Works

Traders typically engage in short selling for speculation and hedging purposes. To open a short position, traders must have a margin account and pay interest on the borrowed stock value during the period the position remains open.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is responsible for enforcing rules and regulations governing registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States, while the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Federal Reserve Board have established minimum amounts that margin accounts must maintain—known as maintenance margin. [1]

Brokers are responsible for locating stocks available for borrowing and returning them when the trade is closed. Opening and closing trades can be executed through regular trading platforms, with brokers needing to be qualified to execute margin trades. To conduct short selling, traders typically follow these steps:

## Timing and Conditions

Timing is crucial for short selling. Stocks typically fall much faster than they rise, and significant stock gains can be erased by earnings misses or other bearish events. Conversely, entering a trade too early can make holding a short position difficult due to costs and potential losses, which can increase if the stock rises rapidly. Short sellers typically look for opportunities in the following situations:

- Bear Markets: Traders who believe "the trend is your friend" have better opportunities for profitable short selling in entrenched bear markets than during strong bull phases. Short sellers prefer environments where markets fall quickly, broadly, and deeply to capitalize during these periods.
- Deteriorating Fundamentals: A stock's fundamentals may deteriorate for various reasons—slowing revenue or profit growth, increasing business challenges, and rising input costs squeezing profit margins. Fundamental deterioration may indicate economic slowdowns, adverse geopolitical developments (such as war threats), or bearish technical signals (like new highs on declining volume).
- Bearish Technical Indicators: Short selling can be successful when technical indicators confirm bearish trends. These indicators may include breaks below key long-term support levels or bearish moving average crossovers, such as the death cross. An example of a bearish moving average crossover is when a stock's 50-day moving average falls below its 200-day moving average. Moving averages are simply the average price of a stock over a set period. If current prices break through averages, either down or up, it may signal a new price trend.
- High Valuations: Sometimes, sectors or entire markets can reach very high valuation levels amid widespread optimism about long-term prospects. Market professionals refer to this phase of the investment cycle as "priced for perfection" because investors always become disappointed at some point when their lofty expectations fail to materialize. Experienced short sellers may wait until the market or sector rolls over and begins its decline phase rather than rushing to establish short positions.

## Short Selling Costs

Unlike buying and holding stocks or investments, short selling involves substantial costs beyond the usual trading commissions paid to brokers. Some costs include:

- Margin Interest: Since short selling can only be done through margin accounts, interest payable on short trades can accumulate, especially when short positions remain open for extended periods.
- Stock Borrowing Costs: Hard-to-borrow stocks—due to high short interest, limited float, or any other reason—carry "hard-to-borrow" fees that can be very expensive. This fee is based on an annualized rate ranging from a small fraction of a percent to over 100% of the short sale value, prorated based on the number of days the short trade remains open. Broker-dealers typically assess these fees to the client's account.
- Dividends and Other Costs: Short sellers are responsible for paying dividends on shorted stocks to the entity from which the stock was borrowed. For shorted bonds, they must pay any coupons or interest due to the lender.

Short selling is referred to as margin trading. Traders borrow money from brokerage firms using investments as collateral. Investors must meet a 25% minimum maintenance requirement. If the account falls below this level, traders face margin calls and are forced to either deposit more cash or liquidate their positions.[1]

## Short Selling Strategy

Imagine a trader believes that XYZ stock (currently trading at $50) will decline in price over the next three months. They borrow 100 shares and sell them to another investor. Since the trader has sold something they don't own but have borrowed, they are now "short" 100 shares.

A week later, the company that was shorted reports poor quarterly financial results, and the stock falls to $40. The trader closes out the short position by purchasing 100 shares in the open market at $40 to replace the borrowed shares. The trader's profit on the short sale (excluding commissions and interest on the margin account) is $1,000, based on the following calculation: $50 - $40 = $10, $10 x 100 shares = $1,000.

Using the scenario above, suppose the trader didn't close out the short position at $40 but decided to keep it open to profit from further price declines. However, a competitor suddenly steps in to acquire the company at $65 per share, and the stock soars.

If the trader decides to close out the short position at $65, the loss on the short sale would be $1,500, based on the following calculation: $50 - $65 = negative $15, negative $15 × 100 shares = $1,500 loss. In this case, the trader had to buy back the stock at a higher price to cover their position.

The primary objective of hedging is protection, rather than speculative profit motives. Hedging aims to protect gains or mitigate losses in a portfolio. The cost of hedging is twofold. First is the actual cost of implementing the hedge, such as expenses associated with short selling or premiums paid for protective options contracts.

Additionally, there is the opportunity cost of limiting portfolio upside if markets continue higher. If 50% of a portfolio that closely correlates with the S&P 500 is hedged, and the index rises 15% over the next 12 months, the portfolio would only record approximately half that gain, or 7.5%.

**Tip:** Investors can choose to short sell through Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which is a safer strategy as the risk of a short squeeze is lower. Put options provide an alternative to short selling that allows investors to profit from stock price declines without requiring margin.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

If sellers correctly predict price movements, they can achieve positive investment returns, especially when using margin to initiate trades. Using margin provides leverage, meaning traders don't need to commit large amounts of their own capital as initial investment. When executed properly, short selling can be an inexpensive hedge to balance other portfolio holdings.

Traders who short stocks can lose more than 100% of their original investment. The risk lies in the fact that stock prices have no upper limit. Additionally, during the holding period, traders must fund their margin accounts. When it's time to close positions, short sellers may find it difficult to locate enough shares to purchase—either because many other traders are also shorting the stock, or because the stock has low trading volume.

Conversely, if the market or specific stock begins to soar, sellers may get caught in a short squeeze cycle. A short squeeze occurs when a stock rises, forcing short sellers to cover their short positions by buying back shares.

## Regulation

Each country sets restrictions and regulations on short selling in its markets. In the United States, short selling is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Regulation SHO, implemented in 2005, is the primary rule governing short selling, which stipulates that short sales can only be executed in an up or zero-plus tick market, meaning the security price must be rising at the time of the short sale.[2]

Under Regulation SHO, brokers must locate a party willing to lend the shares for shorting, or they must have reasonable grounds to believe that the shares can be borrowed. This prevents naked short selling, where investors sell shares they haven't yet borrowed.[2] In certain circumstances, such as extreme market volatility, the SEC can impose temporary short-selling bans on specific stocks.[3]

In October 2023, the SEC added regulations requiring investors to report their short positions to the SEC and companies lending shares for short selling to report this activity to FINRA.[4] These new rules came after increased scrutiny of short selling, particularly following the 2021 GameStop (GME) meme stock saga, when retail investors drove up the stock price, causing losses for hedge funds that had shorted the company.

**Important Note:** Regulations vary by region. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) oversees short selling in the European Union. Positions exceeding 0.2% of issued shares must be disclosed to regulators, and positions exceeding 0.5% must be publicly disclosed.[5] In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) regulates short selling, which is only permitted for designated securities and must be backed by borrowed shares. Naked short selling is illegal.[6]

## Short Selling Example

Unexpected news events can trigger short squeezes, forcing short sellers to buy at any price to meet their margin requirements. In October 2008, Volkswagen briefly became the world's most valuable public company due to a short squeeze.

In 2008, investors knew that Porsche was attempting to build a position in Volkswagen and gain majority control. Short sellers anticipated that once Porsche gained control of the company, the stock value might decline, so they heavily shorted the stock. However, in a surprising announcement, Porsche revealed they had secretly acquired over 70% of the company's shares using derivatives, triggering a massive feedback loop where short sellers purchased stock to close their positions.

Short sellers were at a disadvantage because 20% of Volkswagen's shares were owned by a government entity unwilling to sell, while Porsche controlled another 70%, leaving almost no stock available for repurchase. Essentially, the short interest and days-to-cover ratios exploded overnight, causing the stock price to jump from a low of around €200 to over €1,000. [7]

## Why Must Short Sellers Borrow Shares?

Since a company has a limited number of outstanding shares, short sellers must first locate the shares. Short sellers borrow these shares from existing long position holders and pay interest to the lenders. This process is typically facilitated behind the scenes by brokers. If there are few shares available for shorting, the interest cost of short selling will be higher.

## What are Short Selling Indicators?

Short selling indicators help investors understand whether the overall sentiment is bullish or bearish. The Short Interest Ratio (SIR) (also known as short float) measures the ratio between the number of shares currently sold short and the number of shares available or "floating" in the market. A very high SIR is associated with stocks that are declining or appear to be overvalued. The Short Interest to Volume Ratio (also known as the Days to Cover Ratio) is the total number of shares held short divided by the stock's average daily trading volume. A high Days to Cover Ratio is also a bearish indicator for a stock.

## Why Does Short Selling Have a Negative Reputation?

Unfortunately, short selling has gained a bad reputation due to strategies employed by unethical speculators who use short selling tactics and derivatives to artificially drive down prices and launch bear raids on vulnerable stocks. In the United States, most forms of such market manipulation are illegal, but they may still occur periodically.

## What is a Short Squeeze?

In short selling, since stocks are sold on margin, even relatively small price increases can lead to larger losses. Holders must buy back their stocks at current market prices to close their positions and avoid further losses. If many people do this simultaneously, such buying demand can drive up the stock price. This can ultimately result in a short squeeze.

## Conclusion

Short selling allows investors and traders to profit from declining markets. Those with bearish views can borrow stocks on margin and sell them in the market, hoping to buy them back at a lower price at some point in the future. While some criticize short selling as betting against the market, many economists believe that the ability to short sell can improve market efficiency and serve as a stabilizing force.[8]
