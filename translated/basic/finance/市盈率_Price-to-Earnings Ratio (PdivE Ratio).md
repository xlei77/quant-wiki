## What is Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)?

Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E) measures the ratio of a company's stock price relative to its earnings per share (EPS). Commonly known as the price or earnings multiple, P/E helps evaluate the relative value of a company's stock. It is particularly useful for comparing a company's valuation against its historical performance, other companies within the industry, or the overall market.

P/E can be calculated on either a historical (trailing) or future (forward) basis.

### Key Takeaways

- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is the ratio between a company's stock price and its earnings per share.
- A high P/E ratio may indicate that a company's stock is overvalued, or that investors expect high growth rates.
- Companies with no earnings or losses have no P/E ratio because there is nothing in the denominator.
- The two most commonly used P/E ratios are forward P/E and trailing P/E.
- P/E ratios are most valuable when comparing similar companies within the same industry or the same company's performance over time.

## P/E Ratio Formula and Calculation

The formula and calculation are as follows:

$$ \text{市盈率} = \frac{\text{每股市场价值}}{\text{每股收益}} $$

To determine the P/E ratio, divide the stock price by the Earnings Per Share (EPS).

The stock price (P) can be easily found by searching for the stock symbol on reputable financial websites. While this specific value reflects the price investors are currently paying for the stock, EPS relates to earnings reported at different times.

EPS is typically provided in two ways. Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) represents the company's performance over the past 12 months. The other is found in earnings releases, which usually provide EPS guidance. This is the company's suggested expectation for its future earnings. These different versions of EPS form the basis for trailing P/E ratio and forward P/E ratio respectively.

## Understanding P/E Ratio

The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is one of the most widely used metrics by investors and analysts when examining relative stock valuations. It helps determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. A company's P/E ratio can also be compared with other stocks in the same industry or the broader market (such as the S&P 500 index).

Analysts interested in long-term valuation trends can look at P/E 10 or P/E 30 metrics, which average earnings over the past 10 or 30 years. These indicators are commonly used to measure the overall value of stock indices (such as the S&P 500) since these long-term metrics can show overall changes across multiple business cycles.

The P/E ratio of the S&P 500 can be traced back to 1927, reaching a low of 5.9 in mid-1949 and a high of 122.4 in mid-2009 (after the financial crisis). The long-term average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is approximately 17.6, meaning that the stocks comprising the index are collectively priced at more than 17 times their weighted average earnings.[1] This average can serve as a benchmark for whether market valuations are above or below historical norms.

**Tip:** Analysts and investors review a company's P/E ratio to determine whether the stock price accurately represents the expected earnings per share.

## Forward P/E Ratio

The most commonly used P/E ratios are the forward P/E ratio and the trailing P/E ratio. A third, less common variant uses the sum of the past two actual quarters plus estimates for the next two quarters.

Forward (or leading) P/E ratio uses future earnings guidance rather than trailing data. Sometimes called the "estimated P/E ratio," this forward-looking metric helps compare current earnings with future earnings and can clarify what earnings would look like without changes and other accounting adjustments.

However, forward P/E ratio metrics have issues—namely, companies may underestimate earnings to exceed the expected P/E ratio when the next quarter's earnings arrive. Additionally, external analysts may provide estimates that differ from company estimates, creating confusion.

## Trailing P/E Ratio

Trailing P/E ratio relies on past performance, calculated by dividing the current stock price by the total EPS from the previous 12 months. It is the most popular P/E ratio indicator because it is considered objective—assuming companies report earnings accurately. However, trailing P/E ratio has its own drawbacks, including the fact that a company's past performance does not necessarily determine future earnings.

Investors typically make purchase decisions based on potential earnings rather than historical performance. Using trailing P/E ratio can be problematic because it relies on fixed earnings per share (EPS) figures while stock prices are constantly changing. This means that if significant events affect a company's stock price positively or negatively, the trailing P/E ratio will not accurately reflect this. Essentially, it may not provide the most up-to-date picture of a company's valuation or potential.

The trailing P/E ratio changes with the company's stock price movements, as earnings are only released quarterly while stocks trade continuously when markets are open. Therefore, some investors prefer forward P/E ratios. If the forward P/E ratio is lower than the trailing P/E ratio, analysts expect earnings to increase; if the forward P/E ratio is higher than the current P/E ratio, analysts expect earnings to decrease.

## Valuation from P/E Ratio

Beyond indicating whether a company's stock price is overvalued or undervalued, the P/E ratio can also reveal how a stock's value compares to its industry or benchmarks like the S&P 500.

The P/E ratio represents the amount investors can expect to invest in a company to receive $1 of that company's earnings. Therefore, it is sometimes called a price multiple because it shows how much investors are willing to pay for each $1 of earnings. If a company has a P/E ratio of 20x, investors are paying $20 for $1 of current earnings.

The P/E ratio also helps investors determine how a stock's market value compares to the company's earnings. In other words, the P/E ratio shows how much the market is willing to pay for a stock today based on its past or future earnings. A high P/E ratio may indicate that the stock's price is high relative to earnings and might be overvalued. Conversely, a low P/E ratio might indicate that the stock price is low relative to earnings.

## P/E Ratio Examples

Let's illustrate this with an example, looking at FedEx Corporation (FDX). We can calculate FDX's P/E ratio as of February 9, 2024, when the company's stock closed at $242.62. The company's earnings per share (EPS) for the trailing 12 months was $16.85. [2]

Let's now look at two energy companies to examine their relative values.

As of the close on February 9, 2024, Hess Corporation (HES) had the following data. We'll use diluted EPS to consider what would happen if all convertible securities were exercised:

- Stock price: $142.07
- Trailing 12-month diluted EPS: $4.49
- P/E ratio: 31.64 ($142.07/$4.49) 3

Thus, HES trades at about 31 times trailing earnings. However, a P/E of 31 isn't helpful unless you have something to compare it to, such as the stock's industry group, benchmark index, or HES's historical P/E range.

HES's P/E ratio is higher than the S&P 500 index, which traded at about 22 times trailing 12-month earnings as of February 9, 2024. [4] To compare HES's P/E ratio with a peer, let's look at Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC):

- Stock price: $169.97
- Trailing 12-month diluted EPS: $23.64
- P/E ratio: 7.19 5

When you compare HES's P/E of 31 to MPC's 7, HES's stock might appear significantly overvalued relative to both the S&P 500 index and MPC. Or, HES's higher P/E might mean investors expect future earnings growth to be much higher than MPC's.

However, no single ratio can tell you everything about a stock. It's prudent to use various financial tools to determine if a stock is fairly valued before investing.

## Investor Expectations

Generally, a high P/E ratio indicates that investors expect higher earnings growth compared to companies with lower P/E ratios. A low P/E ratio may indicate that a company is undervalued, or that the company is performing exceptionally well relative to its past performance. When a company has no earnings or is experiencing losses, the P/E ratio is shown as N/A. While negative P/E ratios can be calculated, they are not commonly used.

P/E ratios can also standardize the value of $1 of earnings across the entire stock market. Theoretically, by taking the median P/E ratio over several years, a standardized P/E ratio can be established, which can then be used as a benchmark and indicate whether a stock is worth buying.

**N/A Meaning:** A P/E ratio of N/A means that this ratio is not available for the company's stock. A company may have an N/A P/E ratio if it is newly listed on a stock exchange and hasn't reported earnings yet (such as in an IPO). It can also mean that the company has zero earnings or negative earnings.

## P/E Ratio and Earnings Yield

The reciprocal of the P/E ratio is the earnings yield (which can be considered as the earnings/price ratio). The earnings yield is EPS divided by the stock price, expressed as a percentage.

If stock A trades at $10 and has an EPS of 50 cents over the past year (TTM), its P/E ratio is 20 (i.e., $10/50 cents), and its earnings yield is 5% (50 cents/$10). If stock B trades at $20 and has an EPS (TTM) of $2, its P/E ratio is 10 (i.e., $20/$2), and its earnings yield is 10% ($2/$20).

The earnings yield is not as widely used as the P/E ratio. The earnings yield is useful if you are concerned about return on investment. For stock investors who receive regular investment income, this might be a secondary consideration. This is why many investors may prefer value-based metrics such as P/E ratios or stocks.

The earnings yield is also useful when companies have zero or negative earnings. Since this is common in high-tech, high-growth, or startup companies, the EPS will be negative and listed as an undefined P/E ratio (shown as N/A). However, if a company has negative earnings, it will have a negative earnings yield that can be used for comparison.

## P/E Ratio and PEG Ratio

Even when calculated using forward earnings estimates, the P/E ratio doesn't always tell you whether the P/E is appropriate for a company's expected growth rate. To address this issue, investors turn to the Price/Earnings to Growth ratio, or PEG.

The PEG ratio measures the relationship between the Price/Earnings ratio and earnings growth to provide investors with a complete picture. Investors use it to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued by analyzing earnings and the company's expected growth rate. The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing a company's trailing 12-month P/E ratio by its earnings growth rate over a given period.

Since it is based on past earnings and future earnings growth, PEG is generally considered more informative than the P/E ratio. For example, a low P/E ratio might suggest a stock is undervalued and worth buying. However, including the company's growth rate to obtain its PEG ratio might tell a different story. When using historical growth rates, the PEG ratio can be called "trailing," and when using projected growth rates, it can be called "forward."

Although earnings growth rates may vary across different industries, stocks with a PEG less than 1 are generally considered undervalued because their price is low relative to their expected earnings growth. A PEG greater than 1 might be considered overvalued, as it indicates the stock price is too high relative to the company's expected earnings growth.[6]

## Absolute P/E Ratio and Relative P/E Ratio

Analysts also distinguish between absolute P/E ratios and relative P/E ratios in their analysis.

The numerator of the ratio is typically the current stock price, while the denominator can be the EPS for the trailing 12 months (TTM), estimated EPS for the next 12 months (forward P/E), or a combination of TTM EPS from the past two quarters and forward P/E for the next two quarters.

When distinguishing between absolute and relative P/E ratios, remember that the absolute P/E represents the P/E ratio for the current period. For example, if today's stock price is $100 and the TTM earnings are $2 per share, the P/E ratio is 50 = ($100/$2).

The relative P/E ratio compares the absolute P/E ratio with a benchmark or related period, such as the range of past P/E ratios over the previous 10 years. The relative P/E shows what portion or percentage of past P/E ratios the current P/E has reached. Relative P/E typically compares the current P/E value against the highest value in the range. Investors can also compare the current P/E to the bottom of the range, measuring how close the current P/E is to historical lows.

If the current P/E is lower than past values (whether comparing to past highs or lows), the relative P/E value will be below 100%. If the relative P/E reaches 100% or higher, it tells investors that the current P/E has reached or exceeded past values.

## Limitations of Using P/E Ratio

Like any other fundamental indicator, the P/E ratio has several important limitations. Companies without profits and no earnings (or negative earnings per share) present challenges in calculating P/E ratios. Analysts differ in their views on how to handle this issue. Some say negative P/E ratios exist, others assign a P/E ratio of 0, while most simply state that the P/E ratio does not exist (N/A) until the company becomes profitable.

The main limitation of using P/E ratios is in comparing P/E ratios of companies from different industries. Because companies earn money in different ways and at different times, valuations and growth rates typically vary significantly between different industries.

Therefore, P/E ratios should only be used as a comparison tool when considering companies within the same industry, as this is the only type that can provide valuable results. For example, comparing the P/E ratio of a retail company with that of an oil and gas drilling company might suggest that one is a better investment, but this is not a convincing conclusion. For instance, when an entire industry has high P/E ratios, a high P/E ratio for an individual company is less concerning.

## Other P/E Ratio Considerations

Since a company's debt affects both stock price and earnings, leverage can distort the P/E ratio. For example, consider two similar companies that differ in their debt holdings. The company with more debt might have a lower P/E ratio than the company with less debt. However, if the business is solid, the company with more debt might generate higher returns due to the risk it takes on.

Another key limitation of the P/E ratio lies in the formula used to calculate it. The P/E ratio relies on accurately presenting both the market value of the stock and the estimated earnings per share. The market determines the stock price available in many places. However, earnings information comes from the company itself. Therefore, it can potentially be manipulated, and analysts and investors must trust company management to provide truthful information. If this trust is broken, the stock will be considered higher risk and less valuable.

To mitigate these risks, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that analysts examine. If a company deliberately manipulates its results, it's difficult to ensure all indicators align in the way they've been altered. This is why the P/E ratio remains a central data point when analyzing public companies, but it's certainly not the only one.

## What is a Good P/E Ratio?

The answer depends on the industry. Certain industries tend to have higher average P/E ratios. For example, in February 2024, the Communication Services Select Sector index had a P/E ratio of 17.60, while the Technology Select Sector index had a P/E ratio of 29.[7]2.[7]8 To roughly understand whether a specific P/E ratio is high or low, compare it with the average P/E ratios of other companies in that industry, and then with other industries and the market.

## Is a Higher or Lower P/E Ratio Better?

Many investors suggest that it's better to buy stocks of companies with lower P/E ratios because you're paying less for each $1 of earnings. A lower P/E ratio is like a lower price tag, making it attractive to investors seeking bargains. However, in practice, there may be reasons behind a company's specific P/E ratio. For example, if a company has a low P/E ratio because its business model is declining, then the bargain is merely an illusion.

## What Does a P/E Ratio of 15 Mean?

A P/E ratio of 15 means that the company's current market value equals 15 times its annual earnings. Literally speaking, if you were to hypothetically purchase 100% of the company's shares, it would take 15 years to recover your initial investment through the company's sustained profits. However, if the company grows or its earnings fluctuate, this 15-year estimate would change.

## Bottom Line

The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is one of many fundamental financial indicators used to evaluate companies. It is calculated by dividing a stock's current market price by its earnings per share. It reflects investor expectations and helps determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its earnings. The P/E ratio is useful for comparing companies within the same industry, such as insurance companies with insurance companies or telecommunications companies with telecommunications companies. It provides insights into market sentiment and investment prospects. However, it should be used alongside other financial metrics as it does not account for future growth prospects, debt levels, or industry-specific factors.
