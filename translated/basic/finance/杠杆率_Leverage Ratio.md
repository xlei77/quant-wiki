## What is Leverage Ratio?

A leverage ratio is a financial metric used to measure how much capital exists in the form of debt (loans), or to assess a company's ability to meet its financial obligations. The category of leverage ratios is very important because companies rely on a combination of equity and debt to fund their operations, and understanding the amount of debt a company holds helps evaluate whether it can repay its debts when they come due.

Several common leverage ratios will be discussed below.

### Key Points

- Leverage ratio is a financial indicator used to evaluate a company's ability to meet its financial obligations.
- Leverage ratios can also be used to measure a company's operating expense composition to understand how changes in output will affect operating income.
- Common leverage ratios include debt-to-equity ratio, equity multiplier, degree of financial leverage, and consumer leverage ratio.
- Banks are subject to regulatory oversight regarding the level of leverage they can maintain.

## What Can Leverage Ratios Tell You?

In most cases, leverage ratios assess a company's ability to meet its financial obligations. Excessive debt can be dangerous for both companies and their investors. However, if a company's operations can generate returns higher than the loan interest rates, debt may help drive growth.

Uncontrolled debt levels can lead to credit rating downgrades or worse. On the other hand, too little debt can also raise questions. Unwillingness or inability to borrow may indicate low operating profit margins.

**Important Note:** Several different ratios can be categorized as leverage ratios. The main factors considered are debt, equity, assets, and interest expenses.

Leverage ratios can also be used to measure a company's operating expense mix to understand how changes in output will affect operating income. Fixed costs and variable costs are two types of operating costs; the mix varies depending on the company and industry.

Another type of leverage ratio is the consumer leverage ratio. This ratio examines the relationship between consumer debt levels and disposable income, used for economic analysis and by policymakers.

**Tip:** Understanding how debt amplifies returns is key to understanding leverage. Debt isn't necessarily bad, especially if it's borrowed to invest in projects that will generate positive returns. Thus, leverage can amplify returns, but it will also amplify losses if returns turn negative.

## Banks and Leverage Ratios

Banks are among the most highly leveraged institutions in the United States. The combination of the fractional reserve banking system and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) protection has created a banking environment where lending risks are limited.

To offset this, three separate regulatory agencies—the FDIC, Federal Reserve Board, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—examine and limit leverage ratios for U.S. banks.[1] These agencies restrict the amount banks can lend relative to the amount of capital they have in their own assets. Capital levels are crucial because if total asset values decline, banks can "write down" the capital portion of their assets. Assets financed by debt cannot be written down because bondholders and depositors of the bank are entitled to these funds.

The regulation of bank leverage ratios is highly complex. The Federal Reserve has established guidelines for bank holding companies, although these restrictions vary according to the ratings assigned to banks. Generally, banks experiencing rapid growth or facing operational or financial difficulties are required to maintain higher leverage ratios.[2]

**Note:** Several forms of capital requirements and minimum reserves imposed through the FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency indirectly affect leverage ratios for U.S. banks.

Scrutiny of leverage ratios has increased since the Great Recession of 2007-2009, when "too big to fail" banks became emblematic of making banks more solvent. These pressures haven't disappeared. The restrictions are becoming more stringent.[3]

In 2023, following the collapse of several lending institutions, regulators proposed substantial increases in capital buffers for banks with assets of $100 billion or more. These restrictions naturally limit lending amounts, as raising capital is more difficult and expensive for banks than borrowing. Higher capital requirements might reduce dividends or dilute stock value if more shares are issued.[4]

For banks, the Tier 1 leverage ratio is the most commonly used by regulators.[5, 6]

## Types of Leverage Ratios

There are many different leverage ratios. Below, we'll look at some of the more common ones.

Perhaps the most well-known financial leverage ratio is the Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E). Its expression is:

$$ \text{债务权益比率} = \frac{\text{总负债}}{\text{总股东权益}} $$

For example, in the quarter ending June 30, 2023, United Parcel Service had long-term debt of $19.35 billion and total shareholders' equity of $20 billion. The company's D/E for that quarter was 0.97.[7]

A higher debt-to-equity ratio typically indicates that a company has been aggressive in financing growth with debt. This can result in volatile earnings due to additional interest expense. If a company's interest expenses grow too high, it may increase the risk of default or bankruptcy.

Generally, a D/E ratio greater than 2.0 indicates a risky scenario for investors; however, this benchmark can vary by industry. Businesses that require substantial capital expenditure (CapEx), such as utilities and manufacturing companies, may need to take on more loans than others.

**Tip:** It's best to compare a company's leverage ratios with its past performance and companies operating in the same industry for better context.

The Equity Multiplier is similar but uses assets instead of debt in the numerator:

$$ \text{权益乘数} = \frac{\text{总资产}}{\text{总权益}} $$

For example, suppose Macy's has assets valued at $19.85 billion and shareholder equity of $4.32 billion. The equity multiplier would be:

$$ \$19.85 \text{ 亿美元} \div \$4.32 \text{ 亿美元} = 4.59 $$

Although debt isn't explicitly mentioned in the formula, it's an implicit factor given that total assets include debt.

Remember, Total Assets = Total Debt + Total Shareholders' Equity. The company's high ratio of 4.59 implies that assets are primarily funded by debt rather than equity. From the equity multiplier calculation, Macy's assets are funded by $15.53 billion in liabilities.

The equity multiplier is a component used in DuPont Analysis to calculate Return on Equity (ROE):

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{杜邦分析} = NPM \times AT \times EM\\ &\textbf{其中：}\\ &NPM=\text{净利润率}\\ &AT=\text{资产周转率}\\ &EM=\text{权益乘数}\\ \end{aligned} $$

**Tip:** Generally, it's better to have a lower equity multiplier as this means the company hasn't generated excessive debt to finance its assets.

The Debt Capitalization Ratio measures the amount of debt in a company's capital structure. It is calculated as:

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{总债务资本化} = \frac{(SD + LD)}{(SD + LD + SE)}\\ &\textbf{其中：}\\ &SD=\text{短期债务}\\ &LD=\text{长期债务}\\ &SE=\text{股东权益}\\ \end{aligned} $$

In this ratio, operating leases are capitalized, and equity includes both common and preferred stock. Analysts might decide to use total debt instead of long-term debt to measure debt used in a company's capital structure. In this case, the formula would include minority interest and preferred stock in the denominator.

The Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL) is a ratio that measures the sensitivity of a company's earnings per share (EPS) to fluctuations in its operating income due to changes in its capital structure. It measures the percentage change in EPS for a unit change in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), expressed as:

$$ \begin{aligned} &DFL = \frac{\% \text{ EPS 变化}}{\% \text{ EBIT 变化}} \\ &\textbf{其中：}\\ &EPS=\text{每股收益}\\ &EBIT=\text{息税前利润}\\ \end{aligned} $$

DFL can also be expressed using the following formula:

$$ DFL = \frac{EBIT}{EBIT - \text{利息}} $$

The ratio indicates that the higher the degree of financial leverage, the more volatile the earnings. Since interest is typically a fixed expense, leverage amplifies returns and EPS. This is good when operating income is rising but can be problematic when operating income is under pressure.

The Consumer Leverage Ratio is used to quantify the amount of debt the average American consumer has relative to their disposable income.

Some economists suggest that the rapid growth in consumer debt levels over recent decades has been a contributing factor to corporate profit growth. Others blame high levels of consumer debt as a primary cause of the Great Recession.

$$ \text{消费者杠杆比率} = \frac{\text{家庭总债务}}{\text{个人可支配收入}} $$

The Debt-to-Capital Ratio is one of the most meaningful debt ratios because it focuses on the relationship of debt liabilities as a component of a company's total capital base. It is calculated by dividing a company's total debt by its total capital, which is total debt plus total shareholders' equity. Debt includes all short and long-term obligations.

The ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial structure and how its operations are financed. Generally, the higher the debt-to-capital ratio, the more risk of default. If the ratio is very high, earnings may not be sufficient to cover the costs of debt and liabilities.

Again, what constitutes a reasonable debt-to-capital ratio depends on the industry. Some industries use more leverage than others.

The Debt-to-EBITDA Leverage Ratio measures the amount of income available to pay off debt before accounting for interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses. The ratio is commonly used by credit rating agencies and is calculated by dividing both short and long-term debt by EBITDA to determine the probability of default on issued debt.

The ratio helps determine how many years of EBITDA would be required to pay off all debt. Generally, a ratio above 3 might be concerning, though this can vary by industry.

The Debt-to-EBITDAX Ratio is similar to the Debt-to-EBITDA ratio. It simply measures debt relative to EBITDAX instead of EBITDA. EBITDAX stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation (or depletion), amortization, and exploration expenses. It extends EBITDA by excluding exploration costs (a common expense for oil and gas companies).

The ratio is commonly used in the United States to normalize different accounting treatments of exploration expenses (full cost versus successful efforts). Exploration costs typically appear in financial statements as exploration, abandonment, and dry hole costs. Other non-cash charges that should be added back include impairments, accretion of asset retirement obligations, and deferred taxes.

Another leverage ratio related to interest payments is the Interest Coverage Ratio. One problem with just examining a company's total debt obligations is that they don't tell you anything about the company's ability to service the debt. This is exactly what the interest coverage ratio aims to address.

The ratio equals operating income divided by interest expense, showing the company's ability to pay interest. Generally, a ratio of 3.0 or higher is ideal, though this varies by industry.

The Times Interest Earned (TIE), also known as the Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio, is a variant of the interest coverage ratio. This leverage ratio attempts to highlight cash flow relative to interest due on long-term debt.

To calculate the ratio, find a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), then divide by the interest expense on long-term debt. Pre-tax earnings are used because interest is tax-deductible; ultimately, the entire earnings can be used to pay interest. Again, higher numbers are more favorable.

## What is leverage in finance?

Leverage is using debt to make investments. The goal is to generate returns higher than the cost of borrowing. If a company fails to do this, it is neither doing a good job nor creating value for shareholders.

## How to Calculate Leverage Ratios?

There are various leverage ratios, and each ratio is calculated differently. In many cases, it involves dividing a company's debt by something else, such as shareholders' equity, total capital, or EBITDA.

## What is a Good Leverage Ratio?

This depends on the specific leverage ratio being used and the type of company. For example, capital-intensive industries rely more on debt than service companies, so they tend to have higher leverage. To measure what constitutes an acceptable level, look at leverage ratios specific to the industry. It's also worth remembering that having very little debt isn't necessarily a good thing. Companies can use debt to generate greater returns for shareholders.

## Bottom Line

Leverage ratios are useful tools. They provide a simple way to understand the extent to which a company relies on debt to fund its operations and expansion.

Debt is important. When used properly, it can generate returns above its cost. However, too much is dangerous and can lead to default and financial bankruptcy.

Leverage varies by industry. Some types of companies rely more on debt than others, and even banks are told how much leverage they can hold. Leverage ratios are best compared against historical figures or peer groups.
