## What is a Free Trade Agreement (FTA)?

A Free Trade Agreement is an agreement between two or more countries to reduce import and export barriers between them. Under free trade policies, goods and services can be bought and sold across international borders with little to no government tariffs, quotas, subsidies, or prohibitions to inhibit their exchange.

The concept of free trade stands in contrast to protectionism or economic isolationism.

### Key Points

- Free trade agreements reduce or eliminate cross-border trade barriers.
- Free trade is the opposite of protectionism.
- In the US and EU, free trade agreements are not without regulation and oversight.

## How Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) Work

In the modern world, free trade policies are typically implemented through formal and reciprocal agreements between relevant countries. However, a free trade policy may simply be the absence of any trade restrictions.

Governments do not need to take specific actions to promote free trade. This non-interventionist stance is known as "laissez-faire trade" or trade liberalization.

Governments implementing free trade policies or entering into free trade agreements do not necessarily abandon all control over imports and exports, nor do they eliminate all protectionist policies. In modern international trade, few free trade agreements (FTAs) achieve completely free trade.

**Important Note:** The benefits of free trade were outlined in economist David Ricardo's 1817 book "Principles of Political Economy and Taxation." [1]

For example, a country might allow free trade with another nation while making exceptions to prohibit imports of specific drugs not approved by its regulatory agencies, unvaccinated animals, or processed foods that don't meet its standards.

It may also implement policies that exclude certain products from duty-free status to protect domestic producers from foreign competition.

In principle, free trade at the international level is no different from trade between neighbors, towns, or states.

However, it allows businesses in each country to focus on producing and selling goods that best utilize their resources, while other businesses import goods that are scarce or unavailable domestically. This combination of local production and foreign trade enables countries to experience faster growth while better meeting consumer demands.

This view was first popularized by economist David Ricardo in 1817 in his work "Principles of Political Economy and Taxation." He argued that free trade expands the variety of goods available to a country, lowers prices, and better utilizes its native resources, knowledge, and specialized skills. [1]

## Free Trade Model

Before the 19th century, global trade was primarily dominated by mercantilist theory. This theory prioritized maintaining favorable trade balances relative to other countries and accumulating more gold and silver.

To achieve favorable trade balances, countries often established trade barriers, such as taxes and tariffs, to prevent their residents from purchasing foreign goods. This incentivized consumers to buy locally manufactured products, thereby supporting domestic industries.

Ricardo proposed the law of comparative advantage, which states that countries can maximize their benefits through free trade. Ricardo demonstrated that if countries prioritize producing goods that they can produce more cheaply than other countries (i.e., goods in which they have a comparative advantage), they will be able to produce a greater total quantity of goods than when trade is restricted.[2]

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Free Trade

Free trade has enabled rapid economic growth in many countries. By focusing on exports and resources where they have strong comparative advantages, many countries have been able to attract foreign investment capital and provide relatively high-paying jobs for local workers.

For consumers, free trade creates a competitive environment where countries strive to offer their resources at the lowest possible prices. This, in turn, allows manufacturers to offer finished products at lower prices, ultimately increasing purchasing power for all consumers.

However, there are economic losers when a country opens its borders to free trade. Domestic industries may be unable to compete with foreign competitors, leading to local unemployment. Large industries may relocate to countries with looser environmental and labor laws, resulting in child labor or pollution.

Free trade can also make countries more dependent on global markets. For example, while certain goods might be cheaper on the world market, it may be strategically important for a country to produce these goods domestically. In the event of war or crisis, the country might be forced to rebuild these industries from scratch.

### Pros and Cons of Free Trade

#### Advantages

- Allows consumers to access the cheapest goods available in global markets.
- Enables countries with relatively cheap labor or resources to benefit from foreign exports.
- According to Ricardo's theory, countries can collectively produce more goods by trading based on their respective comparative advantages.

#### Disadvantages

- Competition from foreign exports may lead to local unemployment and business closures.
- Industries may relocate to jurisdictions with looser regulations, resulting in environmental damage or abusive labor practices.
- Countries may become dependent on global markets for critical goods, putting them at a strategic disadvantage during crises.

## Public Opinion on Free Trade

There is a divergence between economists and the public regarding free trade. Studies show that American economists support free trade policies at a significantly higher rate than the general public.[3]

In fact, American economist Milton Friedman stated: "There is almost unanimous agreement among economists that free trade is desirable."[4]

Free trade policies are less popular among the general public. Key concerns include unfair competition from countries with lower labor costs, which can compete by lowering prices, and high-paying jobs flowing to overseas manufacturers.

Calls for the public to "Buy American" may ebb and flow with political winds, but they never completely disappear.

Not surprisingly, financial markets see the other side of the coin. Free trade represents an opportunity to open up other parts of the world to domestic producers.

Moreover, free trade is now an integral part of the financial system and investment world. U.S. investors can now access most foreign financial markets and obtain a broader range of securities, currencies, and other financial products.

However, completely free trade in financial markets is unlikely in today's era. World financial markets have many supranational regulatory organizations, including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and the Committee on Capital Movements and Invisible Transactions.

## Examples of Free Trade Agreements

The European Union is a prominent example of free trade today. Member states form a virtually borderless single entity for trade purposes, with most countries adopting the euro to further clear the path. [5][6]

It should be noted that the system is overseen by a central bureaucracy that must manage numerous trade-related issues that arise between member state representatives. [7]

The United States currently has numerous free trade agreements. These include multilateral agreements such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which covers Canada and Mexico, and the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which includes Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. There are also individual trade agreements with countries ranging from Australia to Peru. [8][9][10]

Overall, these agreements mean that about half of all industrial goods entering the United States are duty-free, according to government data. The average import tariff on industrial goods is 2%. [11]

All these agreements combined still fall short of the most laissez-faire form of free trade. Special interest groups in the United States have successfully lobbied for trade restrictions on hundreds of imported goods, including steel, sugar, automobiles, milk, tuna, beef, and denim.

## Why Establish Free Trade Zones in China?

Starting from 2013, China began establishing free trade zones around major ports and coastal regions. These areas feature relaxed national regulations to promote foreign investment and business development.[12]

## What is a Free Trade Area?

A free trade area is a group of countries that agree to reduce or eliminate trade barriers for trade within the region. This allows participating countries to benefit from reduced tariffs while maintaining their existing protections for trade with countries outside the region.

## What are the Arguments Against Free Trade?

Opponents often claim that free trade invites foreign competition with domestic industries, leading to unemployment and damage to critical sectors. In some cases, free trade causes manufacturers to relocate their operations to countries with less regulation, rewarding companies that pollute or engage in abusive labor practices. In other instances, countries with weak intellectual property laws may steal technology from foreign companies.

## Bottom Line

Free trade refers to policies that allow low-cost imports and exports without tariffs or other trade barriers. In free trade agreements, a group of countries agrees to reduce their tariffs or other barriers to promote greater exchange with trading partners. This enables all countries to benefit from lower prices and access to each other's resources.
