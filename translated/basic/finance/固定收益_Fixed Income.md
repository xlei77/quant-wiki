## What is Fixed Income?

Fixed income refers to investment securities that pay investors fixed interest or dividends until maturity. At maturity, investors receive back their initial principal investment. Government and corporate bonds are the most common fixed income products.

Unlike stocks that may not pay income to investors or variable income securities that change based on certain underlying indicators (such as short-term interest rates), fixed income securities have predetermined payment amounts that remain constant throughout their term.

In addition to directly purchasing fixed income securities, investors can also choose to invest through various fixed income exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds.

### Key Points

- Fixed income refers to assets and securities that pay investors a certain level of income, usually in the form of fixed interest or dividends.
- Government and corporate bonds are the most common fixed income products.
- Fixed income securities are generally considered to have lower returns and lower risk compared to stocks.
- For many fixed income securities, at maturity, investors receive their initial principal investment in addition to the interest payments.
- In the event of company bankruptcy, fixed income investors typically have priority over common stockholders for compensation.

## Understanding Fixed Income

Companies and governments issue debt securities to raise funds for supporting daily operations and financing large projects. These fixed-income instruments reward investors' capital by paying fixed interest rates. At maturity, investors receive their initially invested amount, known as the principal.

For example, a company might issue a $1,000 bond with a 5% interest rate for a five-year term. Investors purchase this bond for $1,000 and won't receive repayment until the five-year term ends. During these five years, the company pays interest (known as coupon payments) based on the 5% annual rate.

Therefore, investors will receive $50 in interest annually, and after five years (at maturity), investors will receive their initial $1,000 investment back. Investors can also find fixed-income investments that pay coupons monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually.

Fixed-income securities are recommended for conservative investors seeking to diversify their portfolios. The percentage allocated to fixed income in a portfolio depends on the investor's investment style. Investors might also choose to diversify their portfolio with a combination of fixed-income products and stocks, such as 50% fixed-income products and 50% stocks.

Treasury bonds, municipal bonds, and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are examples of fixed-income products. These products each have unique advantages and limitations as investments.

## Types of Fixed Income Products

As mentioned earlier, the most common examples of fixed income securities are government or corporate bonds. Bonds are traded over-the-counter (OTC) in bond markets and secondary markets.

Securities issued by the U.S. government are called Treasury securities and are the most common type of government securities. Non-U.S. governments and corporations also issue fixed income securities.

Here are common types of fixed income products:

- Treasury Bills (T-bills) are short-term fixed income securities with maturities under one year that don't pay coupons. Investors buy T-bills at a discount to face value and profit from the difference at maturity.
- Treasury Notes (T-notes) have maturities between 2 and 10 years, pay fixed interest rates, and are sold in multiples of $100. Investors receive interest payments semi-annually throughout the note's term. At maturity, they receive the principal.
- Treasury Bonds (T-bonds) are similar to T-notes but mature in 20 or 30 years. T-bonds can also be purchased in multiples of $100.
- Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) protect investors from inflation. The principal amount of TIPS bonds adjusts with inflation and deflation.
- Municipal bonds are similar to Treasury bonds but are issued and backed by state, local governments, or counties to raise funds for local expenditures. Municipal bonds may also offer tax-exempt benefits to investors.
- Corporate bonds come in many types, with prices and interest rates primarily dependent on the company's financial stability and creditworthiness. Bonds with higher credit ratings typically pay lower coupon rates.
- Junk bonds (also called high-yield bonds) are issued by corporations and pay higher coupon rates due to higher default risk. Default occurs when a company fails to pay the principal and interest on bonds or debt securities.
- Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are fixed income instruments offered by financial institutions with terms up to five years. They offer higher rates than typical savings accounts and are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).

**Important Note:** Traditional portfolio theory suggests that efficient investment strategies should balance risk and return and should diversify between stocks and bonds. Stocks typically carry higher risk with greater potential returns, while fixed income securities are relatively safe with typically lower returns.

## How to Invest in Fixed Income

Investors who wish to include fixed-income securities in their portfolio have multiple options. Today, most brokerage firms offer clients direct access to various bond markets, including government bonds, corporate debt, and municipal bonds.

1. For investors who don't want to select individual bonds, fixed-income mutual funds (bond funds) provide exposure to a variety of bonds and debt instruments. These funds offer investors income streams and professional portfolio management.

2. Fixed-income ETFs work similarly to mutual funds but may be more convenient and cost-effective for individual investors. These ETFs might target specific credit ratings, maturity dates, or other factors. ETFs also incur professional management fees.

3. Investors can also take a laddering approach to fixed-income investing. This strategy provides steady interest income through investments in a series of short-term bonds with different maturity dates.

As bonds mature, portfolio managers reinvest the returned principal into additional short-term bonds, thus continuing the investment ladder. This method provides investors with available capital and allows them to avoid missing opportunities due to rising market interest rates.

For example, a $60,000 investment might be divided among one-, two-, and three-year bonds. The investor decides to invest $20,000 in each type of bond.

When the one-year bond matures, the $20,000 principal will be reinvested in a bond that matures after the original three-year period ends. When the second bond matures, these funds will be moved into a bond with a one-year extension, and so on. This approach provides investors with continuous interest income and the ability to take advantage of higher interest rates.

**Note:** Fixed-income investing is typically a conservative strategy, with returns coming from predictable, low-risk securities.

## Fixed Income Example

Suppose PepsiCo issues fixed-rate bonds to finance the construction of a new bottling plant in Argentina. The 5% bonds have a face value of $1,000 and will mature in five years. The company plans to repay the debt using revenues from the new plant.

You purchase 10 bonds for a total cost of $10,000 and will receive $500 in interest annually (0.05 x $10,000 = $500).

The company receives $10,000 and uses these funds to build the overseas plant. The interest is fixed, providing you with stable income. At maturity after five years, the company will repay you the $10,000 principal. Over the five years, you earn a total of $2,500 in interest ($500 x five years).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Fixed Income

### Income Generation

Fixed income investments provide investors with a stable stream of income throughout the life cycle of bonds or debt instruments. They offer issuers much-needed access to capital. The stable income allows investors to plan their expenditures, which is why these products are popular in retirement portfolios.

### Relatively Low Volatility

The interest payments from fixed-income products can help investors stabilize the risk and return in their investment portfolioâ€”specifically market risk.

For investors holding stocks, price fluctuations can lead to significant gains or losses. The steady interest payments from fixed-income products can partially offset losses caused by declining stock prices. Therefore, these safer investments help diversify portfolio risk.

### Collateral/Security

Fixed income investments in Treasury bonds are backed by the U.S. government.

While corporate bonds are not insured, they are supported by the financial viability of their underlying companies. If a company declares bankruptcy or liquidation, bondholders have priority over common stockholders in claiming company assets.

Additionally, bond investments held at brokerage firms are protected by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which covers up to $500,000 in cash and securities per account. Fixed income Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), with coverage up to $250,000 per investor.

**Note:** Fixed rates are suitable for low-risk investments, but once you lock in a rate, you cannot increase it. Fixed income securities perform poorly during periods of inflation because newly issued bonds will offer higher yields.

Although fixed income products have many advantages, like all investments, investors should clearly understand the risks involved before making a purchase.

### Credit and Default Risk

As mentioned earlier, government bonds and certificates of deposit are guaranteed through the government and FDIC. When selecting corporate bond investments, it's necessary to consider the credit ratings of both the bond and the underlying company to assess default risk. Bonds rated below BBB are considered low-quality bonds (meaning your risk of loss is higher) and are viewed as junk bonds.

Company-related credit risk can affect the valuation of fixed-income instruments in various ways. For example, if a company experiences financial difficulties, its bonds may decline in price in the secondary market.

If an investor attempts to sell bonds of a distressed company, these bonds might sell at a price below face value. Additionally, liquidity may also be an issue. That is, the bond might be difficult to sell at a fair price in the open market, or there may even be a risk of being unable to sell it at all.

Bond prices may fluctuate throughout their lifecycle. If investors hold bonds until maturity, price fluctuations don't matter because investors will receive the bond's face value at maturity.

However, if bondholders sell their bonds before maturity through a broker or financial institution, investors will receive proceeds at the current market price at the time of sale. The selling price may result in either an increase or decrease in investment returns, depending on the underlying company, coupon rate, and current market interest rates.

### Interest Rate Risk

Fixed income investors may face interest rate risk. This refers to situations where, in a rising market interest rate environment, the interest rate paid by bonds may lag behind market rates. In such cases, bonds will depreciate in the secondary market (for bonds, when interest rates rise, prices fall). Moreover, investors' capital is locked into the investment and cannot be deployed into other investments offering higher yields without incurring initial losses.

For example, if an investor purchases a two-year bond paying 2.5% annually, and two-year bond rates jump to 5%, the investor's yield is locked in at 2.5%. Regardless of market interest rate fluctuations, investors holding fixed-income products always receive the same fixed rate.

### Inflation Risk

Inflation risk is another danger faced by fixed-income investors. The rate at which prices rise in the economy is called inflation. If inflation increases, it erodes the returns of fixed-income securities. For example, if a fixed-income security yields 2% and inflation rises by 1.5%, the investor's real return is only 0.5%.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Fixed Income Summary

#### Advantages

- Stable fixed income stream
- More stable returns compared to stocks
- Higher claim on assets in bankruptcy
- Some securities are backed by government and FDIC guarantees

#### Disadvantages

- Returns are typically lower than other investments
- Credit and default risks exist
- Sensitive to interest rate risk
- Sensitive to inflation risk

**Note:** Some government bonds, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), are linked to changes in inflation rates to provide moderate protection for investors.

## Fixed Income Analysis: Factors to Consider

When deciding which financial products to invest in, many investors conduct fixed income analysis. This analysis helps evaluate which investments best match your investment profile.

For example, fixed income analysis typically begins with risk. There is a relationship between risk and return for every investment. All else being equal, investments with higher risk should offer higher returns.

Therefore, fixed income analysis evaluates not only how well investors can tolerate the risks they take but also whether the level of risk taken is appropriate for the return on fixed income securities.

For fixed income securities, risk is closely related to the issuing company's credit rating, the term of the fixed income security, and the industry in which the company operates. For instance, you'll typically find that fixed income securities issued by the U.S. government offer relatively lower returns.

Because of their lower default risk, U.S. bonds are generally considered a safe investment approach. In contrast, corporations (especially those with cash flow issues) may carry more risk but offer higher returns.

Some fixed income securities provide periodic payments. This allows investors to receive cash flows during the investment period. This also reduces risk, as not all funds need to be returned when potentially long-term bonds mature.

Finally, different fixed income securities have various features that make them more or less attractive. Some can be repurchased, meaning the debtor can repay the bond in full before maturity. Others allow for the conversion of fixed income securities into common stock.

Understanding these features is crucial because they can reduce an investor's returns.

## Examples of Fixed Income Securities

Fixed income securities are debt instruments that pay interest at a fixed rate. These may include bonds issued by governments or corporations, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and commercial paper. Preferred stock is sometimes also considered fixed income, as it is a hybrid security that combines characteristics of both debt and equity.

## What are the differences between fixed income and equity securities?

Fixed income securities are debt instruments that pay interest to investors and return the principal at bond maturity. Equity, on the other hand, is not debt. Equity represents shares of company stock, representing the holder's residual ownership in the company. Stocks do not mature and do not guarantee income payments in the form of dividends. Generally, stocks carry higher risk and potential returns compared to corporate debt.

## How Does Inflation Affect Fixed Income?

Inflation typically has a negative impact on the value of fixed-income securities. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Bond prices and other fixed-income securities have a negative correlation with interest rate changes.

## What are the differences between fixed-rate and variable-rate bonds?

Fixed-rate bonds pay the same interest rate throughout their entire maturity period. In contrast, floating or variable-rate bonds periodically reset their interest rates based on prevailing market rates.

## Conclusion

Fixed income refers to the fixed interest rate paid to investors by debt securities and the return of principal. Fixed income securities include different types of bonds and certificates of deposit.

As an asset class, fixed income generally has lower volatility than stocks (equities) and is considered a more conservative investment. A reasonably diversified portfolio should include a certain proportion of fixed income. For some investors, this proportion increases as the investment horizon shortens (for example, when approaching retirement).
