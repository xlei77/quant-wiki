## What is Volatility?

Volatility is a statistical measure that indicates the degree of dispersion in returns for a specific security or market index. It is typically measured using the standard deviation or variance of returns. In most cases, higher volatility indicates greater risk in the security.

In securities markets, volatility is typically associated with large price fluctuations. For example, when the stock market consistently rises or falls by more than 1% over a period, it is referred to as a volatile market.

An asset's volatility is a key factor in pricing option contracts.

### Key Points

- Volatility represents the magnitude of price fluctuations of an asset around its average price.
- There are multiple ways to measure volatility, including beta coefficient, options pricing models, and standard deviation of returns.
- Turbulent assets are typically considered riskier than assets with lower volatility because price movements are harder to predict.
- Implied volatility measures the market's expected volatility, while historical volatility measures price movements over past periods.
- Volatility is a crucial variable in options pricing calculations.

## Understanding Volatility

Volatility typically refers to the risk or uncertainty associated with the magnitude of changes in a security's value.

High volatility means that a security's value may be distributed across a wider range. This implies that within a short period, the security's price can fluctuate significantly, either upward or downward. Low volatility indicates that the security's value doesn't fluctuate much and tends to be stable.

One way to measure asset movement is to quantify daily returns (the percentage change in daily prices). Historical volatility, based on historical prices, represents the degree of variation in asset returns. This value is dimensionless and expressed as a percentage.

While variance captures how asset returns are dispersed around their mean, volatility is a variance measure bounded by a specific time period. Therefore, we can report daily, weekly, monthly, or annualized volatility. It's useful to think of volatility as an annualized standard deviation.

## How to Calculate Volatility

Volatility is typically calculated using variance and standard deviation (standard deviation is the square root of variance). Since volatility describes changes over a specific time period, you only need to multiply the standard deviation by the square root of the time period:

Where:

- σ = Standard deviation of returns
- T = Number of periods in the time range

For simplicity, let's assume our monthly stock closing prices are $1至$10. For example, the first month is $1，第二个月为$2, and so on. To calculate variance, follow these five steps.

Next, take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation, which results in $2.87。这是风险的度量，显示了价值相对于平均价格的分散程度，给交易者一个价格可能偏离平均水平多远的印象。

如果价格是从正态分布中随机抽样的，那么约68%的数据值将落在一个标准差内。95%的数据值将落在两个标准差内（在我们的例子中为2 × 2.87），而99.7%的所有值将落在三个标准差内（3 × 2.87）。

在这种情况下，$1 to $10 are not randomly distributed on a bell curve, but rather uniformly distributed. Therefore, the expected 68%-95%-99.7% percentages do not hold true. Nevertheless, traders often use standard deviation because price return datasets tend to follow standards that more closely approximate a normal distribution (bell curve).

**Tip:** Stock price volatility is considered mean-reverting, meaning periods of high volatility tend to moderate while low volatility tends to increase, fluctuating around a long-term average.

## Types of Volatility

Implied Volatility (IV), also known as expected volatility, is one of the most important indicators for options traders. As its name suggests, it enables traders to judge how turbulent the market will be in the future.

This concept also provides traders with a method of calculating probabilities. It's important to note that this is not a science and therefore does not predict future market direction.

Unlike historical volatility, implied volatility is derived from the option's price itself and represents expectations of future volatility. Because it is implied, traders cannot view past performance as an indicator of future performance. Instead, they must estimate the option's potential in the market.

**Note:** Implied volatility is a key characteristic of options trading.

Historical Volatility (HV), also known as statistical volatility, evaluates the volatility of the underlying security by measuring price movements over a predetermined time period. When historical volatility rises, the security's price fluctuates more than normal. At this point, market changes are typically expected. If historical volatility decreases, it indicates that uncertainty has been eliminated and the market will return to normal.

This calculation can be based on intraday movements, but is usually based on changes from one closing price to the next. Depending on the expected duration of options trading, historical volatility can be measured between 10 and 180 trading days.

## Volatility and Option Pricing

Volatility is a key variable in option pricing models, estimating the degree of fluctuation in underlying asset returns before option expiration. Volatility, used as a percentage coefficient in option pricing formulas, derives from daily trading activities, and the method of measuring volatility affects the value of the coefficient used.

Volatility is also used to price option contracts using models such as the Black-Scholes model or binomial tree models. The more volatile the underlying asset, the higher the option premium, as volatility increases the probability of the option becoming profitable at expiration.

Option traders attempt to predict the future volatility of assets, thus the prices of options in the market reflect their implied volatility.

**Important Note:** Higher volatility generally leads to higher market prices for option contracts.

## Other Volatility Measurement Indicators

A measure of the relative volatility of a specific stock compared to the market is its Beta. Beta value approximately represents the overall volatility of a security's returns relative to its benchmark (typically using the S&P 500 index). For example, a stock with a beta of 1.1 would rise 110% when the benchmark increases by 100%.

Conversely, a stock with a beta of 0.9 would rise 90% when the benchmark increases by 100%.

Market volatility can also be observed through the Volatility Index (VIX), which is a quantitative measure of stock market volatility.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange created the VIX as an indicator to measure the expected 30-day volatility of the U.S. stock market, based on real-time quotes of S&P 500 index call and put options. It effectively measures the sentiment of investors and traders betting on the future direction of the market or specific securities. High VIX readings indicate increased market risk.

Traders can use various options and exchange-traded products to trade the VIX, or use VIX values to price certain derivatives.

## Tips for Managing Volatility

Investors may find periods of high volatility unsettling as prices can fluctuate dramatically or suddenly drop. Long-term investors are advised to ignore short-term volatility and maintain their established strategy. This is because over the long term, stock markets tend to rise. Meanwhile, emotions like fear and greed can be amplified in turbulent markets, potentially undermining long-term investment strategies.

Some investors may use volatility as an opportunity to add to their portfolios by buying when prices are relatively cheap.

You can also use hedging strategies to deal with volatility, such as buying protective put options to limit downside losses without having to sell any stocks. However, note that put option prices also increase when volatility is high.

## Volatility Example

Suppose an investor is building a retirement portfolio. Since she will retire in the next few years, she wants to find stocks with low volatility and stable returns. She is considering two companies:

A more conservative investor might choose Company ABC because it has lower volatility and its short-term value is more predictable.

## What is Volatility in Mathematical Terms?

Volatility is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree of dispersion of data around its mean over a specific time period. It is calculated by multiplying the standard deviation by the square root of the number of time periods T. In finance, it represents this dispersion of market prices, expressed on an annualized basis.

## Is Volatility Equal to Risk?

Volatility is commonly used to describe risk, but this is not always correct. Risk involves the probability of suffering losses, while volatility describes the magnitude and speed of price movements. If an increase in price fluctuations also increases the possibility of losses, then risk will rise accordingly.

## Is Volatility a Good Thing?

Whether volatility is good or bad depends on what type of trader you are and your risk tolerance. For long-term investors, volatility can mean trouble, but for day traders and options traders, volatility often represents trading opportunities.

## What Does High Volatility Mean?

If volatility is high, it means that prices are changing rapidly and dramatically (whether rising or falling).

## What is VIX?

VIX is the volatility index of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), measuring short-term volatility in the broader market through the implied volatility of 30-day S&P 500 options contracts. VIX typically rises when stocks fall and declines when stocks rise. Also known as the "Fear Index," VIX can serve as an indicator of market sentiment, with higher values indicating greater volatility and investor fear.

## Conclusion

Volatility refers to the magnitude and speed of price movements within a specific time period. In the stock market, increased volatility often reflects investor fear and uncertainty. This is why the Volatility Index (VIX) is sometimes called the "fear index."

Meanwhile, volatility provides opportunities for intraday traders to enter and exit positions. Volatility is also a crucial component in options pricing and trading.
