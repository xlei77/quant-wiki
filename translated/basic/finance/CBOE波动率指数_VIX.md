## What is the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)?

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a real-time index that represents market expectations of the relative strength of near-term price changes in the S&P 500 Index (SPX). Since it is derived from the prices of near-term SPX index options, it generates a forward-looking 30-day volatility forecast. Volatility, which is the rate of price change, is generally viewed as a way to measure market sentiment, particularly the level of fear among market participants.

The index is more commonly known by its ticker symbol, simply referred to as "VIX." It was created by the CBOE Options Exchange and is maintained by CBOE Global Markets. This is an important index in trading and investment because it provides a quantifiable indicator of market risk and investor sentiment.

### Key Points

- The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is a real-time market index that represents market expectations of volatility over the next 30 days.
- Investors use the VIX to measure levels of market risk, fear, or stress to help make investment decisions.
- Traders can also trade the VIX through various options and exchange-traded products, or use VIX values for derivatives pricing.
- The VIX typically rises when stocks fall and declines when stocks rise.

## How Does the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) Work?

The VIX aims to measure the magnitude of price fluctuations (i.e., volatility) in the S&P 500. The more dramatic the price movements in the index, the higher the volatility, and vice versa.

Beyond serving as a volatility measurement index, traders can trade VIX futures, options, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to hedge against or speculate on volatility changes in the index.

Generally, volatility can be measured through two different methods. The first method is based on historical volatility, using historical prices over a specific time period for statistical calculations. This process involves calculating various statistics, such as mean, variance, and ultimately arriving at the standard deviation.

The second method, which is used by the VIX, derives its value through implied volatility from options prices. Options are derivatives whose prices depend on whether a particular stock's current price will move sufficiently within a given time period to reach a specific level (called the strike price).

Since the probability of this price movement within a given timeframe is represented by the volatility factor, various options pricing methods (such as the Black-Scholes model) use volatility as a crucial input parameter.

Given that options prices are available in the public market, investors can derive the volatility of the underlying security through them. This volatility implied or derived from market prices is called forward-looking implied volatility (IV).

## Extending Volatility to Market Level

The VIX was the first benchmark index launched by CBOE to measure market expectations of future volatility.

As a forward-looking index, it is constructed using the implied volatility of S&P 500 index options, representing the market's expectation of 30-day future volatility for the S&P 500 index, which is considered a leading indicator for the broader U.S. stock market.

Since its introduction in 1993, the VIX has become an established and globally recognized measure of U.S. stock market volatility. Its calculation is based on real-time S&P 500 index prices, computed from 3:00 AM to 9:15 AM and 9:30 AM to 4:15 PM Eastern Time. Since April 2016, CBOE has begun disseminating VIX values outside U.S. trading hours.

## VIX Value Calculation

The VIX calculation uses standard SPX options traded on the CBOE, which expire on the third Friday of each month, as well as weekly SPX options that expire on other Fridays. Only SPX options with expiration times between 23 days and 37 days are considered.

Although the formula is mathematically complex, its theoretical process is: estimating the expected volatility of the S&P 500 index by aggregating weighted prices of various SPX puts and calls across a series of strike prices.

All eligible options must have valid non-zero bid and ask prices, which represent the market's view of which option strike prices will be hit by the underlying stock during the remaining time to expiration.

For detailed calculations and examples, refer to the "VIX Index Calculation: Step-by-Step" section in the VIX White Paper.

## Evolution of the VIX

When first established in 1993, the VIX was calculated as a weighted measure of implied volatility from eight at-the-money put and call options on the S&P 100, at a time when the derivatives market was limited and in its growth phase.

As the derivatives market developed, ten years later in 2003, CBOE collaborated with Goldman Sachs to update the VIX calculation methodology.

Subsequently, it began using a larger set of options based on the broader S&P 500 index, an expansion that allowed for more accurate observation of investors' expectations of future market volatility. The adopted methodology has remained effective since then and is used to calculate various other volatility index variants.

When markets decline, volatility, investor fear, and VIX values tend to rise. Conversely, when markets strengthen, index values, fear, and volatility tend to decrease.

The S&P 500's price movements often show an inverse relationship with the VIX: when the S&P 500 drops sharply, the VIX rises; and vice versa.

**Note:** Typically, VIX values above 30 are associated with significant volatility due to increased uncertainty, risk, and investor fear. VIX values below 20 generally correspond to periods of market stability and low stress.

## How to Trade the VIX

The VIX has paved the way for treating volatility as a tradable asset, albeit through derivative products. CBOE launched the first exchange-traded futures contract based on the VIX in March 2004, followed by VIX options in February 2006.

These VIX-related instruments allow investors to gain pure volatility exposure and have created a new asset class. Active traders, large institutional investors, and hedge fund managers use VIX-based securities for portfolio diversification, as historical data shows that volatility has a strong negative correlation with stock market returns—that is, when stock returns decline, volatility rises, and vice versa.

Like all indices, the VIX itself cannot be purchased directly. Instead, investors can gain exposure through futures or options contracts, or through VIX-based exchange-traded products (ETPs). For example, the ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (VIXY) and the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) are two products that track variants of the VIX index and take positions in related futures contracts.

**Note:** Options and futures on VIX-based products can be traded on CBOE and CFE platforms.

Active traders using proprietary trading strategies and sophisticated algorithms utilize VIX values for pricing derivatives based on high-beta stocks. Beta represents how much a particular stock's price fluctuates relative to the broader market index.

For example, a stock with a beta of +1.5 theoretically means it is 50% more volatile than the market. Traders betting through options on such high-beta stocks use VIX volatility values in appropriate proportions to correctly price their options trades.

With the VIX's growing popularity, CBOE now offers several other variants measuring broad market volatility.

Examples include the CBOE Short-Term Volatility Index (VIX9D), which reflects nine-day expected volatility in the S&P 500 index; the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VIX3M); and the CBOE S&P 500 6-Month Volatility Index (VIX6M). Products based on other market indices include the Nasdaq-100 Volatility Index (VXN); the CBOE DJIA Volatility Index (VXD); and the CBOE Russell 2000 Volatility Index (RVX).

## What Can VIX Tell Us?

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) indicates the level of fear or stress in the stock market—using the S&P 500 index as a proxy for the broader market, hence its popular nickname as the "fear index." The availability of real-time news coverage may stimulate irrational investor behavior. The higher the VIX, the greater the level of fear and uncertainty in the market, with levels above 30 typically indicating significant uncertainty.

## How can investors trade the VIX?

Like all indices, the VIX cannot be purchased directly. However, investors can trade through futures contracts, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) that hold these futures contracts.

## Does the VIX Level Affect Option Premiums and Prices?

Yes, it does. Volatility is one of the main factors affecting stock and index option prices and premiums. Since VIX is the most widely watched measure of broad market volatility, it has a significant impact on option prices and premiums. Higher VIX levels mean higher option prices (i.e., more expensive option premiums), while lower VIX levels mean lower option prices or cheaper premiums.

## How Can I Use VIX Levels to Hedge Downside Risk?

Downside risk can be effectively hedged by purchasing put options that depend on market volatility. Savvy investors tend to buy options when the VIX is relatively low and put option premiums are cheaper. Like insurance, these protective put options typically become expensive when markets decline, so it's best to purchase them when the need for such protection isn't obvious (i.e., when investors perceive market downside risk to be low).

## What is the normal value of VIX?

The long-term average value of VIX is approximately 21. High VIX levels (typically above 30) may indicate increased volatility and fear in the market, usually associated with bear markets.

## Conclusion

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) quantifies market expectations of volatility, providing investors and traders with insights into market sentiment. It helps market participants assess potential risks and make informed trading decisions, such as whether to hedge or engage in directional trades. While the VIX itself is an index that cannot be traded directly, there are various funds and notes available for investors and traders to participate and gain exposure to this index.
