## What is a VIX Option?

A VIX option is a non-equity index option whose underlying asset is the Cboe Volatility Index.

### Key Points

- VIX options are based on the S&P 500 Volatility Index.
- VIX call options provide natural hedging against price decline shocks.
- VIX put options may be more difficult to use because the S&P 500 index rarely rises rapidly.
- VIX options follow European-style option trading model.

## Understanding VIX Options

VIX options offer both call and put choices. Call options can protect portfolios against sudden market downturns, while put options can hedge against quick reversals in short positions on the S&P 500 index. These options enable traders and investors to speculate on future volatility movements.

Since their introduction in 2006, VIX options have become the first tradeable options allowing individual investors to trade market volatility.[1] Trading VIX options serves as a useful tool for investors. By purchasing VIX call options, traders can profit from rapid increases in volatility.

Sharp rises in volatility typically coincide with short-term price shocks in stocks. Increased volatility often (but not always) accompanies downward market trends. Therefore, these call options serve as natural hedging instruments that can be used strategically over longer periods and tactically in the short term. In many cases, they prove more effective than stock index options.

VIX volatility exhibits a pattern of slow declines and rapid increases. Consequently, VIX call options can be highly effective hedging tools when timed correctly; however, VIX put options are relatively more difficult to use effectively. Put options may generate profits for traders who can accurately predict when markets will shift from downward to upward trends.

VIX options are cash-settled and trade European-style. European-style options restrict exercise until expiration. Traders can sell existing long positions or buy equivalent options to close short positions at any time before expiration.

For advanced options traders, VIX options can be integrated into various sophisticated strategies, such as bull call spreads and butterfly spreads. However, calendar spreads may be problematic due to less tight tracking between different expiration series compared to stock options.

## VIX Explanation

The Volatility Index of Cboe Global Markets (Cboe), trading under the symbol VIX. However, VIX differs from other trading instruments. It does not represent the price of commodities, interest rates, or exchange rates, but rather shows the market's expectation of stock market volatility over the next 30 days.[2]

VIX is an index calculated based on S&P 500 options prices. For these S&P options, the VIX is formed from volatility estimates between the current date and the option expiration date. Cboe combines the prices of various options to derive a weighted value of volatility, which the index tracks.[3]

Since its introduction in 1993, the Volatility Index (VIX) was initially a weighted measure of implied volatility from eight S&P 100 at-the-money put and call options. Ten years later, in 2004, it was expanded to use options based on the broader S&P 500 index.[1] This expansion allowed for a more accurate representation of investors' expectations of future market volatility. VIX values above 30 are typically associated with significant volatility due to investor fear or uncertainty. Values below 15 typically correspond to periods of less stress or even complacency in the market.

Due to its tendency to rise significantly during periods of market fear and uncertainty, VIX is also known as the "Fear Index."
