## What is a Limited Partnership (LP)?

A Limited Partnership (LP) is a business owned by two or more parties. These parties must include at least one general partner who manages the business and bears unlimited liability for any debts. Limited partners are only liable for the amount of their investment. Limited Partnerships are different from Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs).

The Limited Partnership structure is commonly used as a vehicle for individuals to pool funds for investments in real estate or other assets.

### Key Points

- A Limited Partnership (LP) is a business entity that requires at least one general partner and one or more limited partners.
- The general partner assumes unlimited financial liability, while other partners are only liable for their investment amount.
- LPs are pass-through entities with little to no reporting requirements.
- Most U.S. states govern the formation of limited partnerships and require registration of the entity.

## Limited Partnership (LP) Operating Structure

A Limited Partnership must have at least one general partner and one or more limited partners.[1]

The general partner maintains complete management control of the enterprise and bears unlimited financial liability for its financial obligations. Limited partners have little to no involvement in management, and their liability is restricted to the amount of their investment in the LP.

Hedge funds and real estate investment funds are typically structured as LPs to protect their investors from financial exposure to downside risks.

**Note:** A partnership agreement should be established to outline the specific responsibilities and rights of both general and limited partners.

## Types of Partnerships

Generally, any partnership is a business owned by two or more individuals. There are three forms of partnerships: Limited Partnerships, General Partnerships, and Limited Liability Partnerships.

In all forms of partnerships, each partner contributes resources such as property, money, skills, or labor, and consequently shares in the business's profits and losses. At least one partner is responsible for determining the day-to-day affairs of the business. This partner is typically known as the general partner.

Most Limited Partnerships (LPs) are formed by investors pooling funds to invest in assets such as real estate. LPs differ from other partnerships in that, except for the general partner, other partners have limited liability, meaning they are not responsible for business debts beyond their initial investment amount.

The general partner is responsible for the daily management of the limited partnership and is liable for the company's financial obligations, including debts and lawsuits. All other contributors are known as limited (or silent) partners. They provide funding but cannot make management decisions and are not liable for any debts beyond their initial investment.

**Important Note:** If limited partners take a more active role in the LP, they may become personally liable.

General Partnerships (GPs) are business structures that require all partners to share jointly in the business's profits, management responsibilities, and debt obligations. Partners share profits and responsibilities equally unless otherwise specified in the legal partnership agreement. [2]

Joint ventures are a type of general partnership formed to complete a specific project and will dissolve upon the project's completion. All partners have equal rights to control the business and share any profits or losses. They also have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of other members and the joint venture. [3]

Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) are a type of corporation that gives all partners limited financial liability. All partners can also participate in management decisions. [4]

This differs from limited partnerships, where at least one general partner must have unlimited liability, and limited partners cannot participate in management. LLP partners are not responsible for other partners' misconduct or negligence. [4]

LLPs are most commonly used as business structures for groups of professionals such as lawyers or accountants.

## How to Establish a Limited Partnership

Almost all U.S. states govern the formation of limited partnerships under the Uniform Limited Partnership Act, which was introduced in 1916 and has undergone multiple revisions since then. The majority of the United States—49 states and the District of Columbia—have adopted these regulations, with Louisiana being the only exception.[5]

To establish a limited partnership, partners must register the business in the applicable state, typically through the local Secretary of State's office. Required business licenses and permits vary by locality, state, or industry.

**Note:** The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) provides a list of all local, state, and federal licenses required to conduct business.[6]

In addition to external filings, partners in a limited partnership must draft a partnership agreement. This is an internal document that defines how the business will operate. The agreement outlines the rights, responsibilities, and expectations of each partner.

This document is not filed with any government entity.

The partnership agreement should identify two key financial aspects of the company:

## Advantages and Disadvantages of LP

The main advantage of an LP for its limited partners is that it protects them from personal financial liability beyond their investment amount. General partners are willing to take on the greatest risk in order to raise capital for their investments.

LP is a pass-through entity for all partners, meaning the entity files Form 1065. Partners receive Schedule K-1 forms to report their share of income or losses on their own individual tax returns.[7] Limited partners do not have to pay self-employment tax since they are not active members of the business.

Another advantage is the simplicity of creating and maintaining a limited partnership. Since the partnership structure is less formal than other partnerships, it may be simpler to set up. Maintenance is also straightforward: partners are not required to attend any form of annual meetings.

On the downside, LPs require general partners to assume unlimited liability. They are responsible for all management decisions and are liable for any debts or mishandling of the business.[4]

If limited partners want to maintain their liability protection, they must stay away from business operations. If their role is deemed to be active, they will lose their personal liability protection.

There are also some disadvantages to the limited partnership structure. Compared to entities like Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), they can be more difficult to transfer ownership and have less flexibility in changing management roles within the business.

#### Advantages

- Provides personal liability protection for limited partners
- Pass-through entity for tax purposes
- Easy to create and report
- Limited partners are not subject to self-employment tax

#### Disadvantages

- General partners bear unlimited personal liability
- Limited partners cannot participate in management decisions
- Difficult to transfer ownership
- Limited flexibility in changing management roles

## LP and LLC

Limited Liability Companies (LLC) and Limited Partnerships share several similarities. Both entities offer flexibility in how they define the roles of their members and the structure of the entity. This includes controlling each member's voting rights, financial terms, or fiduciary responsibilities.

Both types of entities also receive pass-through tax treatment. This means that each investor must report their share of the entity's profits on their personal tax returns. Neither type of company is required to pay federal income tax. [7]

However, there are differences between these two types of legal entities, starting with their corporate structure. Limited Partnerships include general partners and limited partners, while Limited Liability Companies can have any number of members. Generally, all members of an LLC typically have the right to manage the business, while limited partners in an LP cannot be active participants. [4]

Another key difference lies in liability. General partners in an LP assume unlimited personal liability, meaning they may be responsible for any debts and obligations of the company. Limited partners typically are not liable for partnership obligations. On the other hand, LLCs usually provide corporation-like protection for members, where members are not directly liable for company debts. [4]

Finally, LLCs have greater flexibility in terms of taxation. LLCs can choose to be taxed as a C corporation, S corporation, or disregarded entity. [8] The default tax status for both LLCs and LPs is to be taxed as partnerships.

## Limited Partnership and Taxation

In terms of taxation, limited partnerships are treated similarly to general partnerships. Limited partnerships are viewed as pass-through entities and file Form 1065 as an information return. Limited partnerships also provide Schedule K-1 forms to each partner so that their share of business income and losses can be reported on their individual tax returns.[9]

If a limited partnership incurs losses, each partner can deduct these losses on their individual returns up to the amount of their investment in the company. If the losses exceed their investment to date, partners can also carry forward these losses to future years.

The income or losses from limited partnerships are classified as passive income or losses. This is because none of the partners actively participate in the business.

This is particularly important for tax purposes because passive activities can only be offset against other passive income; passive losses can only be used to offset passive gains.

This also plays a key role in self-employment tax. Limited partners do not pay self-employment tax on most payments because they are not active participants in the business. General partners typically must pay self-employment tax.[10]

## What Type of Business is a Limited Partnership?

Limited partnerships are typically established by businesses that own or operate specific assets, such as properties owned by real estate investment partnerships. General partners control the assets, manage the enterprise, and may be personally liable for its debts. All limited partners are investors who have no role in management and are not liable for debts beyond their investment amount.

## What is the difference between LP and LLP?

LP (Limited Partnership) and LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) have similar structures. However, LP has general partners and limited partners, while LLP does not have general partners. In an LLP, all partners bear limited liability. [4]

## What is Limited Partnership Taxation?

Limited partnerships are taxed as pass-through entities, which means each partner receives a Schedule K-1 form to include in their individual tax returns.[7]

## What are the advantages of limited partnerships?

Limited partnerships are ideal entities for raising capital for specific investments or groups of assets. They allow most partners to invest while maintaining limited liability.

## Bottom Line

Limited partnerships are commonly used by hedge funds and investment partnerships because they provide the ability to raise capital without giving up control.

Limited partners invest in the LP and have little to no control over the management of the entity, but their liability is limited to their personal investment. Meanwhile, general partners manage and operate the LP, but their liability is unlimited.
