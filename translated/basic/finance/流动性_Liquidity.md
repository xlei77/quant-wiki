## What is Liquidity?

Liquidity refers to the efficiency or ease with which an asset or security can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. Cash itself has the highest liquidity among all assets. Therefore, the availability of cash is the most significant factor determining whether a market can operate efficiently.

The higher the liquidity of an asset, the simpler and more efficient the process of converting it to cash becomes. Conversely, assets with lower liquidity require more time and may incur higher costs.

### Key Points Summary

- Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset or security can be easily converted into cash without affecting market prices.
- Cash is the most liquid asset, while tangible items have lower liquidity.
- There are two main types of liquidity: market liquidity and accounting liquidity.
- Current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio are the most commonly used liquidity measurement tools.

## Understanding Liquidity

In other words, liquidity describes the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold at a price that reflects its intrinsic value. Cash is universally considered the most liquid asset because it can be converted into other assets most quickly and easily. Tangible assets, such as real estate, artwork, and collectibles, are typically relatively illiquid. Other financial assets, such as stocks and partnership units, occupy different positions along the liquidity spectrum.

For example, if someone wants a refrigerator worth $1,000, cash is the easiest asset to use. If that person has no cash but owns a set of rare books valued at $1,000, they might find it difficult to find someone willing to trade a refrigerator for books. Instead, they must first sell the books and then use the proceeds to buy the refrigerator.

If that person can patiently wait several months or years to make the purchase, this might not be a problem, but if they only have a few days, they would likely need to sell the books at a discount rather than wait for a buyer willing to pay full price. Rare books are an example of an illiquid asset.

**Note:** There are two main ways to measure liquidity: market liquidity and accounting liquidity.

Market liquidity refers to the extent to which a market (such as a country's stock market or a city's real estate market) can buy and sell assets at stable, transparent prices. In the example above, the market liquidity for exchanging rare books for refrigerators is extremely low, almost non-existent.

In contrast, the stock market has high market liquidity. If an exchange has high trading volume and is buyer-dominated, the bid price (buying price) and the price accepted by sellers (selling price) usually differ very little.

Therefore, investors don't have to sacrifice unrealized gains for quick sales. As the spread between bid and ask prices narrows, the market becomes more liquid; when the spread widens, the market becomes more illiquid. Real estate markets are typically far less liquid than stock markets. The liquidity of other asset markets (such as derivatives, contracts, currencies, or commodities) usually depends on their size and the number of public markets where they can be traded.

Accounting liquidity measures an individual's or company's ability to meet their financial obligations using available liquid assets—that is, the ability to pay debts when they come due.

In the example above, the rare book collector's assets are relatively illiquid and likely cannot be sold for their full $1,000 value in an emergency. In investment terms, assessing accounting liquidity means comparing liquid assets to current liabilities, which are financial obligations due within one year.

Various ratios can measure accounting liquidity, and these ratios differ in how they define liquid assets. Analysts and investors use these metrics to identify companies with strong liquidity. This is also seen as an indicator of market depth.

## Measuring Liquidity

Financial analysts focus on whether businesses can cover their short-term obligations using liquid assets. Generally, when using these ratios, a value greater than 1 is considered ideal.

The Current Ratio is the simplest and least demanding. It compares current assets (those that can reasonably be converted to cash within one year) with current liabilities. The formula is:

The Quick Ratio (or Acid-Test Ratio) is somewhat stricter. It excludes inventory and other current assets that are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and short-term investments. The formula is:

A variant of the Quick Ratio only subtracts inventory from current assets, making it slightly more lenient:

The Cash Ratio is the most stringent liquidity ratio. It excludes accounts receivable, as well as inventory and other current assets, strictly defining liquid assets as cash or cash equivalents.

Compared to the Current Ratio or Acid-Test Ratio, the Cash Ratio better evaluates an entity's ability to pay in emergency situations—that is, the worst-case scenario—because even highly profitable companies can run into trouble if they lack liquidity to handle unexpected events. The formula is:

## Liquidity Examples

In terms of investments, equity assets are generally considered highly liquid assets. However, not all stocks or other liquid securities are equal in terms of liquidity. Some options and stocks trade more actively on exchanges than others. More active trading indicates stronger market demand for these stocks, attracting more numerous and stable traders and investors.

**Note:** Besides trading volume, factors such as bid-ask spread width, market depth, and order book data can provide further insight into a stock's liquidity. Therefore, while trading volume is an important factor when evaluating liquidity, one should not rely solely on it.

These highly liquid stocks are typically characterized by their daily trading volumes, which can reach millions or even hundreds of millions of shares. When a stock has high trading volume, it means there are numerous buyers and sellers in the market, allowing investors to easily buy or sell the stock without significantly affecting its price. Conversely, stocks with low trading volumes may be more difficult to buy or sell due to fewer market participants, and thus have lower liquidity.

For example, on March 13, 2023, Amazon (AMZN) had a trading volume of 69.60 million shares on the exchange. In contrast, Intel Corporation (INTC) had a trading volume of only 48.10 million shares, indicating relatively lower liquidity. However, Ford Motor Company (F) had a trading volume of 118.5 million shares, making it the most actively traded and most liquid of these three stocks that day.

## The Importance of Liquidity

If a market is not liquid, it becomes difficult to sell or convert assets or securities into cash. For example, you might own a very rare and valuable family heirloom appraised at $150,000. However, if there is no market (i.e., no buyers) making offers for your item, then this valuation becomes meaningless because no one will pay anywhere near its appraised value—it is highly illiquid. It might even require hiring an auction house as an intermediary to track down potentially interested parties, which takes time and incurs costs.

However, liquid assets can be easily and quickly sold at full value with minimal costs. Companies must also maintain sufficient liquid assets to cover short-term obligations, such as bills or payroll, or they may face a liquidity crisis that could lead to bankruptcy.

## What are the most liquid assets or securities?

Cash is the most liquid asset, followed by cash equivalents such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), or time deposits. Tradable securities, like stocks and bonds listed on exchanges, are typically also highly liquid and can be quickly sold through brokers. Gold coins and certain collectibles can also be rapidly converted to cash.

## What are some illiquid assets or securities?

Over-the-counter (OTC) securities, such as certain complex derivatives, are often highly illiquid. For individuals, assets like houses, timeshares, or cars are relatively illiquid because it can take weeks to months to find buyers, and several more weeks to complete the transaction and receive payment. Additionally, intermediary fees are typically quite high (for example, real estate agents' average commission is 5% to 7%).

## Why Do Some Stocks Have Higher Liquidity Than Others?

Stocks with the highest liquidity are typically those that receive significant attention from various market participants and have high daily trading volumes. These stocks attract more market makers who maintain tighter two-way markets.

Stocks with low liquidity generally exhibit wider bid-ask spreads and less market depth. These stocks tend to have lower visibility, smaller trading volumes, and both lower market value and volatility. As a result, shares of a large multinational bank typically have higher liquidity than those of a small local bank.

## Conclusion

Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset or security can be converted into cash, with cash itself being the most liquid of all assets. Other liquid assets include stocks, bonds, and other securities that can be traded on exchanges. Tangible assets tend to have lower liquidity, meaning that selling these assets (such as houses) may require more time, effort, and cost.

Market liquidity and accounting liquidity are the two main categories of liquidity, and financial analysts use various ratios (such as current ratio, quick ratio, acid-test ratio, and cash ratio) to measure liquidity. Having liquidity is important for both individuals and companies to repay short-term debts and obligations and avoid liquidity crises.
