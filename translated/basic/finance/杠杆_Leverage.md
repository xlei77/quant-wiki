## What is Financial Leverage?

Financial leverage refers to the concept of using borrowed capital as a source of funding. Companies typically use leverage when they invest in themselves for expansion, acquisitions, or other growth initiatives.

Leverage is also an investment strategy that uses borrowed money—specifically, the use of various financial instruments or borrowed capital—to increase the potential return of an investment.

### Key Points

- Leverage refers to using debt (borrowed funds) to amplify returns on investments or projects.
- Companies can use leverage to invest in growth strategies.
- Some investors use leverage to increase their purchasing power in the market.
- There are a series of financial leverage ratios used to measure a company's financial strength, with the most common being the debt-to-assets ratio and debt-to-equity ratio.

## Understanding Financial Leverage

Leverage is the use of debt or borrowed capital to make investments or fund projects. It is typically used to increase an entity's equity base. Both investors and companies use the concept of leverage:

- Investors use leverage to significantly increase the potential returns that an investment may provide. They use various instruments, including options, futures, and margin accounts, to leverage their investments.
- Companies can use leverage to finance their assets. In other words, companies can use debt financing to invest in business operations to affect growth rather than issuing stock to raise capital.

Investors who are not comfortable using leverage directly can gain leverage exposure indirectly in several ways. They can invest in companies that use leverage to finance or expand operations in their normal course of business—without increasing their outlay.

The purpose and result of financial leverage is to multiply the potential returns of a project. At the same time, leverage also multiplies the potential downside risk if the investment is not successful. When people refer to a company, property, or investment as "highly leveraged," it means that the project has more debt than equity.

## How to Calculate Financial Leverage

There is a complete set of leverage financial ratios used to calculate the degree of debt leverage a company uses to maximize profits. Here are several common leverage ratios.

You can analyze a company's leverage by calculating its debt-to-assets ratio. This ratio indicates how much debt a company uses to generate its assets. A high debt ratio indicates that the company relies on leverage to finance its assets. A ratio of 1.0 means the company has $1 of debt for every $1 of assets. If it's below 1.0, it has more assets than debt; if above 1.0, it has more debt than assets.

Remember that when calculating ratios, you use all debt, including both short-term and long-term debt instruments.

Instead of focusing on what a company owns, you can measure leverage by strictly focusing on how assets are financed. The debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) is used to compare money borrowed by the company against funds raised from private investors or shareholders.

A debt-to-equity ratio greater than 1.0 means the company has more debt than equity. However, this doesn't necessarily mean the company is highly leveraged. Each company and industry typically operates in specific ways that may require higher or lower ratios.

For example, startup tech companies may find it difficult to obtain financing and typically must resort to private investors. Therefore, a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.5 (1 dollar of debt for every 2 dollars of equity) might still be considered high for that industry.

You can also use Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) to compare a company's debt against the income it generates in a given period. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio shows how much income is available to repay debt before these operating expenses are deducted from revenue.

Companies with high debt-to-EBITDA ratios carry a high degree of debt relative to company income. The higher the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, the more leveraged the company is.

**Important Note:** One problem with using EBITDA is that it doesn't accurately reflect earnings. This is because it excludes expenses that must be considered. It's a non-GAAP metric that some companies use to create the illusion of higher profitability.

Debt isn't directly considered in the equity multiplier. But it's inherently included because both total assets and total equity have a direct relationship with total debt. The equity multiplier attempts to understand a company's ownership weighting by analyzing how assets are financed. Companies with lower equity multipliers have financed most of their assets with equity, meaning they're not highly leveraged.

DuPont analysis uses the equity multiplier to measure financial leverage. The equity multiplier can be calculated by dividing a company's total assets by its total equity. Once calculated, total financial leverage is multiplied by total asset turnover and profit margin to arrive at return on equity.

For example, if a public company has total assets valued at $500 million and shareholder equity valued at $250 million, the equity multiplier would be 2.0 ($500 million ÷ $250 million). This indicates the company has used equity to finance half of its total assets. But if it had $500 million in assets and $100 million in equity, its equity multiplier would be 5.0. Thus, larger equity multipliers indicate the need for further investigation as more financial leverage may be in use.

Fundamental analysts can also use the Degree of Financial Leverage (DFL) ratio. DFL is calculated by dividing the percentage change in a company's earnings per share (EPS) by the percentage change in its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) over a period.

The goal of DFL is to understand how sensitive a company's EPS is to changes in operating income. A higher ratio will indicate a higher degree of leverage, and companies with higher DFL may have more volatile earnings.

The above formulas are used to evaluate companies' use of leverage in their operations. However, households can also use leverage. By taking on debt and using personal income to pay interest expenses, households can also use leverage.

Consumer leverage is derived by dividing household debt by disposable income. Households with higher calculated consumer leverage have high levels of debt relative to their income and are therefore highly leveraged.

If consumers are too highly leveraged, they may ultimately find it difficult to obtain loans. For example, when households apply for mortgages, lenders typically set debt-to-income limits.

**Important Note:** Financial ratios are most valuable when compared over time or against competitors. Be careful when analyzing leverage ratios across different companies because different industries may require different financing compositions.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Financial Leverage

Some investors and traders use leverage to amplify profits. When your initial investment is multiplied by additional upfront capital, trades can become exponentially more valuable. Using leverage can also give you access to more expensive investment options that would otherwise be unavailable with small amounts of upfront capital.

Leverage is best used in short-term, low-risk situations that require high capital. For example, during an acquisition or takeover, a growth company might have short-term capital needs that lead to strong medium to long-term growth opportunities. Rather than using additional capital to gamble on risky ventures, leverage enables smart companies to execute opportunities at ideal moments with the intention of quickly exiting their leveraged positions.

If leverage can be used to amplify investment returns, losses can be amplified as well. Using leverage results in higher downside risk, sometimes leading to losses greater than your initial capital investment. Moreover, brokers and contract traders typically charge fees, premiums, and margin rates, and require you to maintain margin accounts with specific balances. This means that if you lose money on a trade, you still need to pay additional fees.

Leverage also has complex potential drawbacks. Investors must understand their financial situation and the risks inherited when entering leveraged positions. This may require greater attention to one's portfolio and additional capital contributions if their trading account is not adequately funded according to their broker's requirements.

## Financial Leverage and Margin

Margin is a special type of leverage that involves using existing cash or securities as collateral to increase one's purchasing power in financial markets. Margin allows you to borrow money from a broker at a fixed interest rate to purchase securities, options, or futures contracts with the potential for very high returns.[1]

You can use margin to create leverage that increases your purchasing power beyond the total amount in your margin account. For example, if you need $1,000 in collateral to purchase securities worth $10,000, your margin ratio is 1:10 or 10x leverage.

## Example of Financial Leverage

Suppose a company is established with a $5 million investment from investors. This equity is the capital the company can use for operations. If the company uses debt financing and borrows $20 million, it now has $25 million to invest in business operations and more opportunities to create value for shareholders. However, its debt-to-equity ratio will be high. Depending on its industry and average ratios, such a high ratio might be either expected or concerning.

These types of leveraged positions happen frequently. For example, Apple (AAPL) issued its third green bond worth $4.7 billion in March 2022.[2] Through debt financing, Apple can expand low-carbon manufacturing and create recycling opportunities while using carbon-free aluminum. This type of leverage strategy can work when the generated revenue exceeds the debt created by issuing bonds.

## What is Financial Leverage?

Financial leverage is a strategic effort to borrow money to invest in assets. The goal is to generate returns from these assets that exceed the cost of borrowing. The objective of financial leverage is to increase profitability without using additional personal capital.

## What are examples of financial leverage?

One example of financial leverage is purchasing rental property. If an investor only pays 20% as a down payment, they borrow the remaining 80% of the cost from lenders to purchase the property. The investor then attempts to rent out the property, using rental income to pay the monthly principal and debt obligations. If the investor can meet their obligations with the income received, they have successfully used leverage to gain personal resources (i.e., ownership of the house) and potential residual income.

## How to Calculate Financial Leverage?

Financial leverage can be calculated in several different ways. There is a set of financial ratios known as leverage ratios, which are used to analyze a company's level of debt relative to various assets. The two most common financial leverage ratios are the debt-to-equity ratio (total debt/total equity) and the debt-to-assets ratio (total debt/total assets).

## What is a Good Financial Leverage Ratio?

Generally, a debt-to-equity ratio greater than 1 indicates that a company has chosen to take on more debt rather than finance through shareholders. While this isn't inherently bad, the company may face greater risks due to the inflexibility of debt obligations. The company must be compared with similar companies in the same industry or through its historical financial data to determine whether it has a good leverage ratio.

## Why is Financial Leverage Important?

Financial leverage is important because it creates opportunities for both investors and businesses. For investors, these opportunities come with high risks, as leverage amplifies losses during downturns. For businesses, leverage results in more debt, which may become difficult to repay if there is a slowdown in the coming years.

## Bottom Line

Individuals and companies can increase their equity base in multiple ways. Financial leverage is one such method. For businesses, financial leverage involves borrowing money to drive growth. It allows investors to gain exposure to certain instruments with less initial outlay.

Since using leverage carries risks, it's important to compare the advantages and disadvantages and determine whether financial leverage truly suits your financial situation and objectives.
