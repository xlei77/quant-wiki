## What is Monetary Policy?

Monetary policy refers to a set of tools used by a country's central bank to control the overall money supply and promote economic growth, employing strategies such as adjusting interest rates and changing bank reserve requirements.

In the United States, the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy through a dual mandate: achieving maximum employment while controlling inflation.[1]

### Key Points

- Monetary policy is a series of actions aimed at controlling a country's overall money supply and achieving economic growth.
- Monetary policy strategies include revising interest rates and changing bank reserve ratios.
- Monetary policy is typically classified as either expansionary or contractionary.
- The Federal Reserve System typically employs three monetary policy strategies, including reserve requirements, discount rates, and open market operations.

## Understanding Monetary Policy

Monetary policy is the control of the amount of money available in the economy and the channels for new money supply.

Economic statistics such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation rate, and industry and sector-specific growth rates influence monetary policy strategies.

Central banks may modify the interest rates at which they lend to the country's banks. As interest rates rise or fall, financial institutions adjust their rates for customers such as businesses or home buyers.

Additionally, it may buy or sell government bonds, set foreign exchange rates, and modify the amount of cash banks need to maintain as reserves.

## Types of Monetary Policy

Monetary policy is considered expansionary or contractionary depending on the level of growth or stagnation in the economy.

Contractionary policy raises interest rates and restricts the outstanding money supply to slow growth and reduce inflation, which is the rise in prices of goods and services in the economy and the decrease in purchasing power of money.[2]

During periods of economic slowdown or recession, expansionary policy stimulates economic activity. By lowering interest rates, savings become less attractive, and consumer spending and borrowing increase.[1]

## Monetary Policy Objectives

Contractionary monetary policy is used to control inflation and reduce the amount of money circulating in the economy. Expansionary monetary policy fuels inflationary pressures and increases money circulation.

Expansionary monetary policy reduces unemployment rates, as higher money supply and attractive interest rates stimulate business activity and expansion in the job market.

Exchange rates between domestic currency and foreign currencies are affected by monetary policy. As money supply increases, domestic currency becomes cheaper relative to foreign exchange.

## Monetary Policy Tools

In Open Market Operations (OMO), the Federal Reserve Bank purchases bonds from or sells additional bonds to investors to change the amount of outstanding government securities and the funds available throughout the economy.[3]

The goal of OMO is to adjust the level of reserve balances to manipulate short-term interest rates, thereby influencing other interest rates.[3]

The central bank may change interest rates or its required collateral. In the United States, this rate is known as the discount rate.[4] Banks will lend more or less freely based on this rate.

**Note:** The Federal Reserve System typically uses three monetary policy strategies, including reserve requirements, discount rates, and open market operations.

Authorities can manipulate reserve requirements, which is the amount of funds banks must keep as a portion of customer deposits to ensure they can meet their obligations.

Lowering this reserve requirement releases more capital for banks to make loans or purchase other assets. Raising requirements restricts bank lending and slows growth.

## Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy

Monetary policy is formulated by central banks with the aim of maintaining economic stability, keeping low unemployment rates, protecting currency value, and sustaining economic growth. Through manipulating interest rates, reserve requirements, or open market operations, central banks influence borrowing, spending, and savings rates.

Fiscal policy is another tool used by governments rather than central banks. While the Federal Reserve can influence the money supply in the economy and affect market sentiment, the U.S. Treasury can create new money and implement new tax policies.[5] It injects funds into the economy either directly or indirectly to increase spending and stimulate growth.[6]

Both monetary and fiscal tools were coordinated in the series of government and Federal Reserve programs launched in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[7]

## How Often Does Monetary Policy Change?

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve System meets eight times per year to determine changes in national monetary policy.[8] The Federal Reserve System may also take action in emergency situations, as seen during the 2007-2008 economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

## How is Monetary Policy Used to Control Inflation in the United States?

Contractionary policies may slow economic growth and even increase unemployment rates, but they are generally considered necessary for stabilizing the economy and controlling prices. During the double-digit inflation period of the 1980s, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate to 20%.[9] Although the impact of high interest rates triggered a recession, inflation rates fell to a range of 3% to 4% in the following years.[10]

## Why is the Federal Reserve System Called the Lender of Last Resort?

The Federal Reserve also acts as the lender of last resort, providing liquidity and regulatory oversight to banks to prevent their failure and avoid financial panic in the economy.[11]

## Conclusion

Monetary policy employs tools used by central bankers to maintain a country's economic stability while limiting inflation and unemployment. Expansionary monetary policy stimulates a recessionary economy, while contractionary monetary policy slows an inflationary economy. A country's monetary policy is typically coordinated with its fiscal policy.
