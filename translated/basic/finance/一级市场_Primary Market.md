## What is the Primary Market?

The primary market is the source of new securities. Typically on exchanges, businesses, governments, and other organizations raise funds through debt or equity securities, usually conducting their initial offerings here. The primary market is facilitated by underwriting syndicates, which consist of investment banks responsible for setting the initial price range for specific securities and overseeing their sale to investors.

Once the initial sale is complete, further trading takes place in the secondary market, which is the main venue for daily trading.

### Key Points

- In the primary market, new stocks and bonds are sold to the public for the first time.
- In the primary market, investors can purchase securities directly from the issuer.
- Types of primary market issuances include Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), private placements, rights issues, and preferential allotments.
- Stock exchanges represent the secondary market, where investors trade with each other.
- Securities issued in the primary market can subsequently be traded in what is known as the secondary market—essentially the stock exchanges we are familiar with.

## Understanding the Primary Market

The primary market is where securities are created. Companies sell or issue (financial term) new stocks and bonds to the public for the first time in this market, known as initial distribution. These stocks and bonds—also called primary instruments—trade on mainstream exchanges, with prices based on their market value.

Companies and government entities sell newly issued common stocks, preferred stocks, corporate bonds, as well as government bonds, notes, and treasury bills in the primary market to fund business improvements or expand operations. Although investment banks may set the initial price of securities and charge fees for facilitating sales, most of the proceeds from sales go to the issuer.

The primary market is not a specific physical location; it rather reflects the nature of the commodities. The key characteristic defining the primary market is that securities are purchased directly from the issuer here, rather than "second-hand" from previous buyers or investors.

**Important Note:** Investors typically pay lower prices in the primary market compared to the secondary market.

All issues in the primary market are strictly regulated. Companies must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other securities authorities, and must obtain approval before selling securities to investors.

After the initial issue is completed (i.e., when all stock shares or bonds are sold), the primary market closes. These securities then begin trading in the secondary market.

## Types of Primary Market Issuance

Initial Public Offering (IPO) is a type of security issued in the primary market. An IPO occurs when a private company sells shares to the public for the first time, commonly known as "going public." The process and the initial price of the new shares are set by designated investment banks, which are commissioned by the company to handle the initial underwriting of the specific stock.

For example, Company ABCWXYZ hired five underwriters to determine the financial details of its IPO. The underwriters indicated that the issue price of the stock would be $15. Investors can therefore purchase the IPO directly from the issuing company at this price. This is the first opportunity for investors to provide capital to the company by purchasing its stock. The company's equity capital consists of funds generated from stocks sold in the primary market.

Rights issues allow companies to raise additional equity through the primary market after their existing securities have entered the secondary market. Existing investors receive rights to new shares based on the number of shares they hold, while others can make new investments in the newly issued shares.

## Private Placement and Primary Market

Other types of primary market stock issuance include private placement and preferential offering. Private placement allows companies to sell shares directly to larger investors (such as hedge funds and banks) without making the stock publicly available. Preferential offering provides shares at special prices to specific investors (typically hedge funds, banks, and mutual funds) at prices that are not available to the general public.

Similarly, businesses and governments seeking financing can choose to issue new short-term and long-term bonds in the primary market. The coupon rate of new bonds corresponds to the prevailing interest rates at the time of issuance, which may be higher or lower than the rates of existing bonds.

## Primary Market and Secondary Market

The primary market is where securities are created and initially issued, while the secondary market is where securities are subsequently traded between investors.

Taking U.S. Treasury securities as an example—these are bonds, notes, and bills issued by the U.S. government. The Treasury Department regularly announces new issues of these debt securities and sells them through auctions held multiple times throughout the year. This is an example of how the primary market operates.

**Tip:** Individual investors can purchase newly issued U.S. Treasury securities directly from the government through TreasuryDirect, an electronic marketplace and online account system.[1] This can save them broker commissions and other intermediary fees.

Suppose some investors (typically brokerage firms, banks, pension funds, or investment funds) who purchased government bonds or notes at auction want to sell these securities. They offer these bonds on stock exchanges or similar venues like NYSE, NASDAQ, or over-the-counter (OTC) markets, where other investors can purchase them. These Treasury securities are now in the secondary market.

For stocks, the distinction between primary and secondary markets may seem somewhat blurred. In fact, the secondary market is commonly referred to as the "stock market," where investors trade shares among themselves on exchanges. However, stock exchanges can actually serve as venues for both primary and secondary markets.

For example, when a company goes public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the initial issuance of new shares constitutes the primary market. The subsequent trading of shares, with prices quoted daily, belongs to the secondary market.

## Types of Secondary Markets

Secondary markets are further divided into two types:

- Auction markets, a public quotation system where buyers and sellers gather in one location and announce the prices at which they are willing to buy and sell securities.
- Market maker markets, where market participants are connected through electronic networks, and market makers maintain an inventory of securities, ready to buy and sell with market participants at any time.

The key difference between primary and secondary markets lies in the seller or source of securities. In the primary market, the issuer of securities is the issuer of shares or bonds. In the secondary market, the seller is another investor or owner. When you purchase securities in the primary market, you are buying newly issued securities directly from the issuer, and this is a one-time transaction. When buying securities in the secondary market, the original issuer of the securities—whether a company or government—is not involved and does not benefit from the transaction.

In short, securities are purchased in the primary market and traded in the secondary market.

## Primary Market Examples

In June 2017, the Republic of Argentina announced it would sell $2.75 billion of debt in two parts for liability management. The joint underwriters included Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse. This was the first time a low-rated government (Argentina had re-entered the debt market the previous year after experiencing massive defaults) offered bonds with a 100-year maturity.[2]

Facebook (now known as Meta) had the largest IPO for an online company and the biggest tech IPO in U.S. history when it went public in 2012. Market expectations were high: many investors believed the stock value would rapidly increase in the secondary market due to the company's popularity and quick success. Based on high primary market demand, underwriters set the share price at $38, at the high end of the target range of $35-38, and increased the stock offering by 25% to 421 million shares. This gave the stock a valuation of $104 billion, the largest valuation for any newly listed company.[3][4]

Although Facebook raised $16 billion through the primary market, the stock price didn't rise significantly on IPO day: after trading 460 million shares, it closed at $38.23 per share, with a turnover rate exceeding 100%. In fact, Facebook's stock price declined sharply later in 2012, reaching a historical low of $17.73 on September 4, 2012.[5]

However, the stock price recovered thanks to the company's strategy focusing on mobile platforms.

If you had invested $10,000 at the IPO, you would have received 263 shares of Facebook common stock. As of February 23, 2024, these shares were priced at $484 each, making your investment worth $127,292.[5] Looking back at the primary market purchase price of $38, it was undoubtedly an attractive discount.

## Relationship Between Primary and Secondary Markets

The primary market and secondary market are both parts of the capitalist financial system, where funds are raised through the buying and selling of securities (such as stocks and bonds). In the primary market, new securities are issued and sold to investors for the first time. Subsequently, investors trade these securities in the secondary market.

The primary market is also known as the new issues market. The secondary market is what we commonly refer to as the stock market or stock exchange.

## Types of Primary Markets

Almost every type of financial asset has a primary market. The largest markets include the primary stock market, primary bond market, and primary mortgage market.

The most common types of primary market issuances include:

- Initial Public Offering (IPO): A company's first issuance of stock to the public
- Rights Issue: An opportunity offered to existing shareholders to purchase additional new shares at a discounted price
- Private Placement: Company stock issuance to individuals, legal entities, or small groups of investors (typically institutional or qualified investors) rather than on the public market
- Preferential Allotment: Offering shares to specific groups at special or discounted prices that differ from publicly traded share prices

## Role of the Primary Market

The primary market is like a debut ball or wedding: it marks the introduction of new securities—corporate stocks or bonds entering the financial market. The primary market enables companies and governments to attract investors to raise capital—used to repay debt or expand business operations. It also allows investors with assets to invest for income generation or participate in the initial stages of a promising new venture.

## Primary and Secondary Markets in India

The primary and secondary markets in India function similarly to those elsewhere: in the primary market, investors purchase stocks or bonds directly from companies in one-time transactions; in the secondary market, investors can trade stocks and bonds among themselves an unlimited number of times.

In India, when companies wish to go public and establish their primary market for shares, they must obtain approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which is similar to the SEC in the United States. [6]

India's secondary market includes BSE Limited (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE)—the two most widely traded exchanges in the subcontinent. [7][8]

## Summary

The primary market is a symbolic venue where new securities make their debut - new bonds and corporate stocks are issued and sold to investors for the first time. These securities are sold by issuing companies, governments, or other entities, typically with the assistance of investment banks, which are responsible for underwriting the newly issued securities, setting prices, and overseeing the issuance.

Almost all types of assets have a primary market, with stocks (equity) and bonds being the most common. There are several different types of primary market issuances, with IPOs being the most common, followed by private placements and rights issues.

Most primary market buyers are institutional investors, although individual investors can easily participate in certain issues, such as new U.S. Treasury securities.

After primary market issuance, existing stocks, bonds, and other securities trade in what is known as the secondary market - essentially the familiar stock exchanges and stock markets.
