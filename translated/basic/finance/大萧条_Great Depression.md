## What is the Great Depression?

The Great Depression was a devastating and prolonged economic downturn that followed the U.S. stock market crash of 1929. It continued until 1941, the year the United States entered World War II. This period was marked by several economic contractions, including the 1929 stock market crash, bank panics of 1930 and 1931, and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act which devastated world trade. Other events and policies also contributed to the continuation of the Great Depression throughout the 1930s.

Economists and historians often refer to the Great Depression as the largest, if not the most catastrophic economic event of the 20th century.

**Important Note:** While it's difficult to pinpoint the exact causes of the Great Depression, economists and historians generally agree that several contributing factors led to this period of recession. These factors include the 1929 stock market crash, the gold standard, declining loans and tariffs, bank panics, and the Federal Reserve's contractionary monetary policy.

## Stock Market Crash

In the United States, the stock market fell by nearly 50%, and corporate profits declined by more than 90% during a brief depression period known as the "Forgotten Depression" from 1920 to 1921. In the following decade, the U.S. economy achieved strong growth. The American public discovered the stock market and dove into it during the Roaring Twenties.[1]

The speculative frenzy affected both the real estate market and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Easy money supply and high levels of margin trading by investors fueled unprecedented rises in asset prices.[2]

In the period leading up to October 1929, stock prices rose to historic highs, reaching more than 19 times after-tax corporate earnings.[3] Combined with the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rising 500% in just five years, this ultimately led to the stock market crash.[4]

On October 24, 1929, the New York Stock Exchange bubble burst violently, a day known as Black Thursday.[5] A brief rally occurred during Friday the 25th and Saturday the 26th's half-day trading, but the following week brought Black Monday (October 28) and Black Tuesday (October 29). The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 20% over these two days.[6] The stock market would eventually fall nearly 90% from its 1929 peak.[4]

The crash's ripples spread across the Atlantic to Europe, triggering other financial crises, such as the collapse of Austria's most important bank, Boden-Kredit Anstalt. By 1931, the economic disaster had fully engulfed both continents.[7]

## The Downward Spiral of the U.S. Economy

The 1929 stock market crash erased nominal wealth from both corporations and individuals, plunging the U.S. economy into a downward spiral. At the beginning of 1929, the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.2%. By 1933, unemployment had soared to over 25%. [8][9]

Despite unprecedented interventions and government spending by both the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations, unemployment remained above 18.9% in 1938. By the end of 1941, when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, real per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was still below its 1929 level.

While the crash may have triggered a decade-long economic downturn, most historians and economists believe that it alone did not cause the Great Depression. Nor does it explain why this recession was so severe and prolonged in its depth and duration. A series of specific events and policies contributed to the Great Depression and fueled its continuation throughout the 1930s.

## The Young Federal Reserve's Mistakes

According to monetarists like Milton Friedman and as acknowledged by former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, the relatively new Federal Reserve mismanaged the supply of money and credit around the 1929 crash.[10]

The Federal Reserve, established in 1913, remained relatively inactive during its first eight years of existence. Then, after the economy recovered from the depression of 1920-1921, it allowed for significant monetary expansion.[11]

Between 1921 and 1928, the total money supply increased by $28 billion, a 61.8% increase.[12] Bank deposits grew by 51.1%, savings and loan shares increased by 224.3%, and life insurance policy net reserves rose by 113.8%. All of this occurred after the Fed reduced reserve requirements to 3% in 1917. Gold reserves acquired through the Treasury and Federal Reserve increased by only $1.16 billion.[13]

The Federal Reserve triggered the rapid expansion before the crash by increasing the money supply and maintaining low interest rates throughout the decade. The excess money supply largely fueled both the stock market and real estate bubbles.

After the bubble burst and markets crashed, the Federal Reserve took the opposite approach, cutting the money supply by nearly one-third. This reduction created severe liquidity problems for many small banks and killed hopes for a rapid recovery.

**Note:** Trade routes established during World War II remained open during the Great Depression and helped markets recover.

## Federal Reserve's Tightening Policy

As Bernanke pointed out in a speech in November 2002, before the Federal Reserve was established, banking panics were typically resolved within weeks. Large private financial institutions would lend money to the strongest smaller institutions to maintain system integrity.[10] This scenario had occurred twenty years earlier during the Panic of 1907.

When frenzied selling led to a spiral decline in the New York Stock Exchange and triggered bank runs, investment banker J.P. Morgan stepped in, rallying Wall Street residents to transfer substantial funds to cash-strapped banks.[14] Ironically, it was this panic that prompted the government to establish the Federal Reserve, reducing dependence on individual financiers like Morgan.

After Black Thursday, heads of several New York banks attempted to restore confidence by purchasing large quantities of blue-chip stocks at prices above market value.[15] These actions led to a brief rally on Friday, but panic selling resumed on Monday. In the decades since 1907, the stock market had grown beyond the capacity of such individual efforts. Only the Federal Reserve had sufficient capability to support the American financial system.

The Fed failed to do this through cash injections between 1929 and 1932. Instead, it watched as the money supply collapsed and allowed thousands of banks to fail. This, along with the collapsed financial sector, led to deflation and stimulated the subsequent depression. Banking laws at the time made it difficult for institutions to grow and diversify sufficiently to withstand large-scale deposit withdrawals or bank runs.

The Federal Reserve's harsh response may have been due to concerns that bailing out careless banks would encourage future fiscal irresponsibility. Some historians argue that the Fed created conditions that led to economic overheating, then exacerbated an already severe economic situation.

## Hoover's Artificially Inflated Prices

Herbert Hoover is often described as a "do-nothing" president, but he took action after the crash. He implemented three major changes between 1930 and 1932:

- Federal spending increased by 42%, engaging in massive public works projects such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC)[16]
- Taxes to pay for new projects
- Immigration ban in 1930 to prevent low-skilled workers from flooding the labor market[17]

Hoover's main concern was that wages would be cut following the economic downturn. He believed that prices must be kept high to ensure high wages across all industries. Consumers would have to pay more to maintain these high prices.

However, the public was severely hit by the crash, and many people didn't have sufficient resources to spend lavishly on goods and services. Companies couldn't count on foreign trade either, as foreigners were unwilling to buy overpriced American goods, just as Americans were.

**Important Note:** Many other interventions by Hoover after the crash and actions by Congress damaged the economy's ability to adjust and reallocate resources, including controls on wages, labor, trade, and prices.[17]

## American Protectionism

This grim reality forced Hoover to use legislation to support prices and wages by strangling cheaper foreign competition. Following the protectionist tradition, he signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, despite protests from over a thousand economists nationwide.

The Act was initially intended to protect agriculture but later expanded into a multi-industry tariff, imposing massive duties on more than 880 foreign products. Nearly thirty countries retaliated, and imports fell from $7 billion in 1929 to $2.5 billion in 1932. By 1934, international trade had declined by 66%. Not surprisingly, global economic conditions deteriorated.[18]

While Hoover's desire to maintain employment and income levels for both individuals and companies was understandable, he encouraged businesses to raise wages, avoid layoffs, and maintain high prices when they should have naturally fallen. In previous recession/depression cycles in America, economic recovery followed price reductions, but only after 1-3 years of low wages and unemployment.

When the U.S. economy could not maintain these artificial levels amid effectively disrupted global trade, the recession deteriorated into a depression.

## The New Deal

When Franklin Roosevelt was elected president in 1933, he promised sweeping changes. His New Deal was a series of innovative, unprecedented domestic programs and legislation aimed at supporting American businesses, reducing unemployment, and protecting the public.[19]

The New Deal was broadly based on Keynesian economics and the view that government could and should stimulate the economy. It set ambitious goals of creating and maintaining national infrastructure, full employment, and healthy wages. The government set out to achieve these goals through controls on prices, wages, and even production.[20]

Some economists claim that Roosevelt continued many of Hoover's interventions, just on a larger scale. He maintained strict attention to price supports and minimum wages, and moved the country off the gold standard, prohibiting individuals from hoarding gold coins and bullion.[21] He banned monopolistic business practices and established dozens of new public works projects and other job-creating agencies.

The Roosevelt administration also paid farmers and ranchers to stop or reduce production. One of the most heartbreaking dilemmas of this period was the destruction of surplus crops while thousands of Americans needed access to affordable food.[20]

Between 1933 and 1940, federal taxes doubled to pay for these initiatives and new programs like Social Security. These increases included higher excise taxes, personal income taxes, estate taxes, corporate income taxes, and excess profits taxes.[19]

## Success and Failure of the New Deal

The New Deal brought measurable results, including financial system reform and stability, as well as enhanced public confidence. Roosevelt declared a week-long bank holiday in March 1933 to prevent institutional collapse due to panic withdrawals. This was followed by a construction program of dams, bridges, tunnels, and road networks. These projects launched federal work programs that employed thousands of people.

The economy showed some recovery, but the rebound was too weak to consider the New Deal policies successful in pulling America out of the Great Depression. Historians and economists disagree on the reasons:

- Keynesians blame insufficient federal spending, arguing that Roosevelt didn't go far enough in his government-centered recovery plan.
- Others claim that Roosevelt may have prolonged the Great Depression, like Hoover before him, by trying to force immediate improvements rather than letting the economic/business cycle follow its usual two-year bottom-out-and-recover process.

A study by two UCLA economists estimated that the New Deal prolonged the Great Depression by at least seven years.[22] However, it's possible that the relatively quick recovery characteristic of other post-depression periods might not have occurred rapidly after 1929, as this was the first time ordinary people, not just Wall Street elites, lost substantial money in the stock market.

American economic historian Robert Higgs argues that Roosevelt's new rules and regulations came so quickly and were so revolutionary that businesses became afraid to hire or invest.[23] Rutgers University law and economics professor Philip Harvey suggests that Roosevelt was more interested in addressing social welfare issues than creating Keynesian-style macroeconomic stimulus programs.

**Note:** The New Deal's social security policies created programs for unemployment, disability insurance, and benefits for the elderly and widows.

## Impact of World War II

Looking at employment and GDP data, the Great Depression appears to have suddenly ended around 1941-1942, when the United States entered World War II. The unemployment rate fell from 8 million in 1940 to just over 1 million in 1943.[24] However, more than 16 million Americans were drafted into the armed forces.[25] During the war, the real unemployment rate in the private sector increased.

Living standards declined due to wartime rationing shortages, and taxes increased significantly to fund the war effort. Private investment dropped from $17.9 billion in 1940 to $5.7 billion in 1943, and total private sector output declined by nearly 50%.[26]

The notion that the war ended the Great Depression is a broken window fallacy, but the conflict did set America on a path to recovery. The war opened channels for international trade and reversed price and wage controls. Government demand for cheap products created massive fiscal stimulus.

After the war ended, private investment increased from $10.6 billion to $30.6 billion in the first 12 months. The stock market experienced a bull run that lasted several years.

## When did the Great Depression begin?

The Great Depression began after the stock market crash of 1929, which wiped out nominal wealth of both individuals and corporations. This sent the U.S. economy into a downward spiral and eventually spread beyond American borders into Europe.

## When did the Great Depression end?

The Great Depression ended around 1941, approximately when the United States entered World War II. Most economists consider this the end date, as that's when unemployment rates fell and GDP growth resumed.

## How Did the Great Depression End?

The traditional view holds that the United States emerged from the Great Depression due to employment opportunities created by the New Deal, and the government's substantial investment in the private sector in preparation for the country's entry into World War II. Some economists dispute this, arguing that the depression would have ended sooner if there had been less government intervention.

## Bottom Line

The Great Depression was the result of a combination of unfortunate factors, including an erratic Federal Reserve, protectionist tariffs, and inconsistent application of government interventionist efforts. If any of these factors had been different, this period could have been shortened or even avoided.

The debate about whether intervention was appropriate continues, but many New Deal reforms still exist today. These include Social Security, unemployment insurance, and agricultural subsidies. The assumption that the federal government should take action during times of national economic crisis has gained strong support. This legacy is one reason why the Great Depression is considered one of the most significant events in modern American history.
