## What is Futures Trading?

Futures are contracts to buy or sell specific underlying assets at a predetermined price on a future date. The underlying assets can be commodities, securities, or other financial instruments. Futures trading requires the buyer to purchase the underlying asset at the set price on the expiration date, or the seller to sell at the set price, regardless of market price.

Futures trading typically refers to futures contracts where the underlying assets are securities in the stock market. The value of these contracts is based on the future value of individual company stocks or stock market indices, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, or NASDAQ. [1] Futures trading conducted on exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange can include underlying "assets" such as physical commodities, bonds, or weather events. [2]

### Key Points

- Futures are derivatives - financial contracts whose value is derived from changes in the price of underlying assets.
- Stock market futures trading requires buyers to purchase certain stocks or a group of stocks at a predetermined future date and price, while sellers must fulfill the obligation to sell accordingly.
- Futures contracts can hedge against price fluctuations of company stocks, groups of stocks, or indices to help prevent losses due to adverse price movements.

## Underlying Assets

Futures traders can lock in the price of underlying assets. These contracts have expiration dates and known fixed prices. Stock futures have specific expiration dates organized by month. The underlying assets for futures contracts may include: 3

- Commodity futures based on physical commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, corn, and wheat
- Cryptocurrency futures based on the volatility of assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum
- Currency futures including the Euro and British Pound
- Energy futures including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and heating oil
- Stock futures based on stocks traded in the market and groups thereof
- Interest rate futures for speculating or hedging future interest rate changes in government bonds and other bonds
- Precious metal futures for gold and silver
- Stock index futures based on underlying assets such as the S&P 500 index

**Important Note:** The buyer of a futures contract must receive the underlying stock or shares at expiration, not before. Buyers of futures contracts can sell their positions before expiration. There is a distinction between options and futures. American-style options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at any time before the contract's expiration date. [4]

## How Futures Trading Works

Futures contracts are standardized in terms of quantity, quality, and asset delivery, making trading possible on futures exchanges. They obligate buyers to purchase shares in stocks or indices at predetermined dates and prices.[5] This ensures market transparency, enhances liquidity, and helps in accurate price formation.

Stock futures have specific expiration dates organized by month. For example, futures on major indices like the S&P 500 might expire in March, June, September, and December.[6] The contract closest to expiration is called the "front-month contract" and typically has the most trading activity. As contracts approach expiration, traders wanting to maintain positions usually roll over to the next available contract month. Short-term traders typically focus on front-month contracts, while longer-term investors might look at contracts further out.[1]

For example, when trading S&P 500 index futures, a trader can buy a futures contract agreeing to purchase shares in the index at a set price six months later. If the index rises, the futures contract's value will increase, and the trader can sell the contract before expiration at a profit. The process of selling futures works in reverse. If a trader believes a stock will fall and sells a futures contract, and the market falls as expected, the trader can buy back the contract at a lower price for a profit.

**Note:** The settlement of futures contracts depends on the asset. Physical delivery is standard for commodities like oil, gold, or wheat. However, for futures contracts based on stocks and stock indices, settlement is done in cash.[1]

## Speculation

Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on commodity prices. If a trader buys a futures contract and the price at expiration is higher than the original contract price, they will profit. However, if the commodity price falls below the purchase price specified in the futures contract, the trader may incur losses. Before expiration, the futures contract—a long position—can be sold at the current price to close the position.

If an investor predicts prices will fall, they can also take a speculative short position. If prices decline, the trader will take an offsetting position to close out. The net difference will be settled at contract expiration. The investor profits if the underlying asset's price is below the contract price; they lose if the current price is above the contract price.

Suppose a trader chooses S&P 500 futures contracts. The index is at 5,000 points, with futures contracts delivering in three months. Each contract is worth $50 per index point, making one contract worth $250,000 (5,000 points × $50). Without leverage, the trader would need $250,000. In futures trading, traders only need to provide margin, which is a fraction of the total contract value.[7] If the initial margin is 10% of the contract value, the trader only needs to deposit $25,000 (10% of $250,000) to enter the futures contract. If the index falls 10% to 4,500 points, the futures contract value will decrease to $225,000 (4,500 points × $50). The trader faces a $25,000 loss, equivalent to a 100% loss of the initial margin.

## Hedging

Futures trading can hedge against price fluctuations in the underlying asset.[2] The goal is to prevent losses due to adverse price changes, rather than speculation. Consider a mutual fund manager responsible for managing a $100 million portfolio that tracks the S&P 500. Given potential short-term market volatility, the fund manager uses S&P 500 futures contracts to hedge the portfolio against possible market declines.

Assume the S&P 500 is at 5,000 points, and each S&P 500 futures contract is based on the index multiplied by a multiplier, such as $250 per index point. Since the portfolio mirrors the S&P 500, assume a "one-to-one" hedge ratio. One futures contract hedges a value of 5,000 points × $250 = $1,250,000. To hedge a $100 million portfolio, the number of futures contracts needed is the ratio of portfolio value to the hedge value per contract: $100,000,000 / $1,250,000 = approximately 80. Therefore, selling 80 futures contracts should effectively hedge the portfolio, with two possible outcomes:

- If the S&P 500 index falls 10% to 4,500 points in three months, the portfolio might lose about 10% of its value, or $10 million. However, the futures contracts sold by the fund manager will appreciate in value, offsetting this loss. Each contract's gain would be (5,000 - 4,500 points) × $250 = $125,000. The total gain from 80 contracts would be 80 × $125,000 = $10,000,000. This gain will effectively offset the portfolio's loss, protecting it from market downside.
- If the S&P 500 index rises in three months, the portfolio's value will increase, but losses on the futures position will offset this gain. This is acceptable since the primary objective is to hedge against downside risk.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Futures Trading

Futures trading has both benefits and drawbacks. Futures trading typically involves leverage, and brokers require initial margin, which is a small portion of the contract value. The amount depends on the contract size, investor's credit status, and the broker's terms and conditions.

Futures contracts can be important tools for hedging against price fluctuations. Companies can plan budgets and protect potential profits against adverse price changes. However, futures contracts also have disadvantages. Due to the leverage used, investors face the risk of losses exceeding their initial margin.

#### Advantages

- Potential speculative returns
- Effective hedging capabilities
- Convenient trading

#### Disadvantages

- Higher risks due to leverage
- Missing out on profits from price movements when hedging
- Margin is a double-edged sword

**Futures Regulation:** The futures market is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC is a federal agency established by Congress in 1974 to ensure the integrity of futures market prices, including preventing abusive trading practices, fraudulent behavior, and supervising brokerage firms involved in futures trading.[8]

## Why Choose Trading Futures Instead of Stocks?

The advantage of trading futures rather than stocks lies in high leverage, allowing investors to control assets with a small amount of capital. This also brings higher risks. Additionally, futures markets are almost always open, offering flexibility to trade outside traditional market hours and respond quickly to global events.

## Which is More Profitable: Futures or Options?

The profitability of futures and options largely depends on the investor's strategy and risk tolerance. Futures typically offer higher leverage and can be more profitable when predictions are correct, but they also come with higher risks. Options provide the security of non-binding contracts and limit potential losses.

## What Happens if an Investor Holds a Futures Contract Until Expiration?

When stocks are the underlying asset, traders who hold futures contracts until expiration settle their positions in cash. Based on whether the underlying asset rises or falls during the holding period, traders will either pay or receive cash settlement. However, in some cases, futures contracts require physical delivery. In such situations, investors who hold contracts until expiration will receive the underlying asset.

## Summary

As an investment instrument, futures contracts provide opportunities for price speculation and risk hedging against potential market downside risks. However, they also have some disadvantages. When hedging, taking opposite positions may result in additional losses if market predictions are inaccurate. Furthermore, the daily settlement of futures prices introduces volatility, causing investment values to fluctuate significantly between trading sessions.
