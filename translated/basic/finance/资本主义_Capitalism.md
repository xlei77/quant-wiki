## What is Capitalism?

Capitalism is an economic system in which capital goods are owned by private individuals or corporations. Business owners employ workers who only receive wages; the labor force does not own the means of production but rather uses them on behalf of the capital owners.

Under the capitalist system, the production of goods and services is based on supply and demand relationships in the general market (also known as a market economy). This contrasts with planned or command economies, where prices are set through central planning.

The purest form of capitalism is free-market or laissez-faire capitalism. Under this system, private entities operate without constraints. They can decide where to invest, what to produce or sell, and at what prices to exchange goods and services. Laissez-faire markets operate without checks or controls. Today, most countries practice a mixed capitalist system, which includes some degree of government regulation of businesses and some level of public ownership in certain sectors.[1]

### Key Points

- Capitalism is an economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of production, where labor only receives wages.
- Capitalism relies on the enforcement of private property rights, which provides incentives for capital investment and productive use.
- Capitalism evolved in Europe from feudalism and mercantilism, and greatly expanded industrialization and the supply of mass-market consumer goods.
- Pure capitalism can be contrasted with pure socialism, where all means of production are collectively or state-owned.

## Understanding Capitalism

Capitalism is a type of economic production and resource allocation system. Unlike socialism or feudalism where economic decision-making is planned through centralized political methods, economic planning under capitalism occurs through decentralized, competitive, and voluntary decisions.

Capitalism is essentially an economic system where the means of production (factories, tools, machines, raw materials, etc.) are organized by one or more business owners, also known as capitalists. The capitalists then employ workers to operate these means of production in exchange for wages. Workers have no ownership over the means of production or the profits generated by their labor; these belong to the capitalists.[1]

Therefore, private property rights are the foundation of capitalism. Most modern concepts of private property derive from John Locke's homesteading theory, in which humans claim ownership by mixing their labor with unclaimed resources. Once owned, the only legitimate means of transferring property is through voluntary exchange, gifts, inheritance, or rehomesteading abandoned property.[2]

Private property improves efficiency by incentivizing resource owners to maximize their property's value. The more valuable a resource is, the greater trading power it provides to its owner. In a capitalist system, those who own property have the right to any value associated with that property.

For individuals or businesses to confidently deploy their capital goods, there must be a system that protects their legal rights to own or transfer private property. Capitalist societies rely on contract, fair trade, and tort law to promote and enforce these private property rights.

When property is not private but shared by the public, a problem known as the tragedy of the commons arises. For a common-pool resource—which everyone can use and no one can restrict access to—everyone has an incentive to extract as much use value as possible while having no incentive to protect or reinvest in the resource. Privatizing the resource is one possible solution to this problem, along with various voluntary or involuntary collective action approaches.[3]

**Note:** Under capitalist production, business owners retain ownership of the goods produced. If workers at a shoe factory take home a pair of shoes they made after their shift, that would constitute theft. This concept is known as the alienation of workers from their labor.

## Capitalism and Profit Motive

The concept of profit is closely tied to private property. By definition, individuals will only voluntarily exchange private property when they believe the exchange benefits them in some spiritual or material way. In such transactions, each party gains additional, subjective value, or profit, from the trade.

The profit motive, or the desire to earn profits from business activities, is the driving force of capitalism. It creates a competitive environment where businesses compete to become low-cost producers of certain goods to gain market share. If producing different types of goods becomes more profitable, businesses are motivated to make the switch.[4]

Voluntary trade is another related mechanism that drives activity in capitalist systems. Resource owners compete with each other for consumers, while consumers in turn compete with other consumers for goods and services. All of these activities are built into the price system, which balances supply and demand to coordinate resource allocation.[1]

Capitalists earn maximum profits by utilizing capital goods, such as machinery and tools, most effectively while producing goods or services of highest value. Conversely, capitalists suffer losses when capital resources are not used efficiently and instead create output of lower value.

**Important Note:** Capitalism is an economic system of production. Markets are systems for distributing and allocating goods that have already been produced. Although they often go hand in hand, capitalism and free markets refer to two different systems.

## Precursors to Capitalism: Feudalism and Mercantilism

Capitalism is a relatively new social arrangement for producing goods in the economy. It emerged primarily with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, around the late 17th century.[5] Before capitalism, other systems of production and social organization were common.

Capitalism evolved from European feudalism. Until the 12th century, only a small fraction of Europe's population lived in towns. Skilled craftsmen lived in cities, but their living expenses came from feudal lords rather than true wages, and most workers were serfs of land-owning nobles. However, by the late Middle Ages, urbanization accelerated, and cities became increasingly important as centers of industry and trade.

Under feudalism, society was divided into social classes based on birth or family lineage. Lords (nobles) were landowners, while serfs (peasants and laborers) did not own land but were employed by land-owning nobles.

The emergence of industrialization radically changed trade and encouraged more people to move to towns where they could earn more money working in factories rather than exchanging labor for subsistence living.

Mercantilism gradually replaced the feudal economic system in Western Europe and became the dominant commercial economic system from the 16th to 18th centuries. Mercantilism initially began as trade between towns, but it wasn't necessarily competitive trade. Initially, each town had distinctly different products and services, which gradually became homogenized by demand over time.[6]

After commodity homogenization, trade occurred on increasingly broader scales: town to town, county to county, province to province, and finally, nation to nation. When too many nations offered similar goods for trade, trade took on a competitive advantage that was intensified by strong nationalist sentiments on a continent constantly embroiled in wars.

Colonialism flourished alongside mercantilism, but nations spreading settlements around the world weren't trying to increase trade. Most colonies had economic systems with feudalistic overtones, their raw materials were shipped back to the mother country, and, using the British North American colonies as an example, they were forced to buy back finished goods with a pseudo-currency that prevented them from trading with other nations.

Economist Adam Smith noted that mercantilism was a regressive system that created trade imbalances between nations and hindered their development. His ideas about free markets opened the door to capitalism for the world.[7]

Adam Smith's ideas came at the perfect time, as the Industrial Revolution was beginning to rumble and would soon shake the Western world. The (often literal) gold mines of colonialism brought new wealth and new demand for domestic industrial products, which drove the expansion and mechanization of production.

As technology advanced rapidly, factories no longer needed to be built near waterways or windmills to operate, and industrialists began building factories in cities where thousands of people were now available to provide labor.

**Note:** Capitalism involves reorganizing society into social classes based on capital ownership (in other words, businesses) rather than land ownership. Capitalists could profit from the surplus labor of the working class, who earned only wages. Thus, the two social classes defined by capitalism are capitalists and the working class.[8]

Industrial titans were the first to accumulate wealth that often exceeded that of landed nobles and many lending/banking families. For the first time in history, common people could hope to become wealthy. The new rich built more factories, needed more labor, and also produced more goods for people to buy.

During this period, the term "capitalism" - derived from the Latin "capitalis" meaning "head of cattle" - came into popular use. In 1850, French socialist Louis Blanc used the term to denote a system of exclusive ownership of industrial means of production by private individuals rather than shared ownership.[9]

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Capitalism

#### Advantages

- More efficient allocation of capital resources
- Competition leads to lower consumer prices
- Comprehensive increase in wages and overall living standards
- Stimulates innovation and invention

#### Disadvantages

- Creates inherent class conflict between capital and labor
- Generates massive wealth gaps and social inequality
- May incentivize corruption and crony capitalism in pursuit of profits
- Produces negative externalities such as pollution

- More efficient allocation of capital resources
- Competition leads to lower consumer prices
- Wages and overall living standards improve across the board
- Stimulates innovation and invention

- Creates inherent class conflict between capital and labor
- Generates massive wealth gaps and social inequality
- May incentivize corruption and crony capitalism in pursuit of profits
- Produces negative externalities such as pollution

More efficient allocation of capital resources: In this system, labor and means of production follow capital, as supply follows demand.

Competition leads to lower consumer prices: Capitalists compete with each other and therefore seek to increase profits by reducing costs (including labor and material costs). Mass production typically benefits consumers as well.

Wages and overall living standards improve across the board: With the help of unions, wages have increased under capitalism. More and better goods become cheaply available to the general public, improving living standards in ways previously unimaginable.

Stimulates innovation and invention: In capitalism, inequality serves as a driver encouraging innovation, which in turn drives economic development.

Creates inherent class conflict between capital and labor: While capitalists enjoy the potential for high profits, workers may be exploited for their labor, with wages consistently below the true value of their work.

Generates massive wealth gaps and social inequality: Capitalism creates enormous gaps between the rich and poor and social inequalities.

May incentivize corruption and crony capitalism in pursuit of profits: Capitalism can provide incentives for corruption arising from favoritism and close relationships between business people and the state.

Produces negative externalities such as pollution: Capitalism often results in a range of negative externalities, such as air and noise pollution, where these costs are borne by society rather than the producers of the impacts.

## Capitalism and Socialism

In terms of political economy, capitalism is typically contrasted with socialism. The fundamental difference between the two lies in the ownership and control of the means of production.

In a capitalist economy, property and enterprises are owned and controlled by individuals. In a socialist economy, the state owns and manages the important means of production. However, there are also other differences in terms of equity, efficiency, and employment.

Capitalist economies are not concerned with equitable arrangements. The socialist model's primary focus is on the redistribution of wealth and resources from the rich to the poor, for the sake of fairness, and ensuring equality of opportunity and outcomes. Equality takes precedence over high achievement, and collective interests over individual opportunities for advancement.

The capitalist argument is that profit incentives motivate companies to develop innovative products that consumers want and are in high demand in the market. Some argue that state ownership of the means of production leads to inefficiency because managers, workers, and developers are less likely to put in extra effort to launch new ideas or products without the motivation to earn more money.

In capitalist economies, the state does not directly employ labor. This lack of government-operated employment can lead to unemployment during economic recessions and depressions.

In socialist economies, the state is the primary employer. During economic hardships, socialist states can mandate hiring, thus achieving full employment. Additionally, socialist systems often have stronger "safety nets" for workers who are injured or permanently disabled. Those who can no longer work have fewer options for assistance in capitalist societies.

**Karl Marx, Capitalism, and Socialism:** Philosopher Karl Marx is known for his critique of the capitalist system of production, which he saw as an engine for creating social ills, massive inequality, and self-destructive tendencies. Marx believed that over time, capitalist enterprises would squeeze each other out of the market through intense competition, while the working class would expand and begin to resent their unfair situation. His solution was socialism, through which the means of production would be transferred to the working class in an equitable manner.[10]

## Types of Capitalism

Today, many countries practice capitalist production, but this exists within a spectrum. In reality, there are elements of pure capitalism that operate alongside socialist institutions.

The standard spectrum of economic systems places laissez-faire capitalism at one extreme and fully planned economies—such as communism—at the other extreme. Anything in between can be described as a mixed economy. Mixed economies contain elements of both central planning and unplanned private enterprise. By this definition, almost every country in the world has a mixed economy.[1]

When the government owns some but not all means of production, and can legally circumvent, substitute, restrict, or otherwise monitor private economic interests, it is called a mixed economy or mixed economic system. A mixed economy respects property rights but imposes limitations on them.

Property owners are restricted in how they can exchange with one another. These restrictions take many forms, such as minimum wage laws, tariffs, quotas, excess profits taxes, licensing restrictions, prohibited products or contracts, direct public appropriation, antitrust legislation, legal tender laws, subsidies, and eminent domain. The government in a mixed economy also owns and operates certain industries, either wholly or partially, especially those considered public goods.

In contrast, in pure capitalism, also known as laissez-faire capitalism or anarcho-capitalism, all industries are privately owned and operated, including public goods, and there is no central government agency providing regulation or oversight of general economic activity.[11]

## What is an Example of Capitalism?

An example of capitalist production is when an entrepreneur starts a new widget company and opens a factory. This person uses their own available capital or capital from external investors to purchase land, build the factory, order machinery, and procure raw materials. Then, the entrepreneur hires workers to operate the machines and produce widgets. Note that the workers do not own the machines they use or the widgets they produce. Instead, they only receive wages in exchange for their labor. These wages represent only a small portion of the income that the entrepreneur receives from the enterprise.

## Who Benefits from Capitalism?

Capitalism tends to benefit capitalists the most. These include business owners, investors, and other owners of capital. While capitalism is praised for raising living standards across the board for many people, it has so far benefited those at the top the most.

## Why is Capitalism Harmful?

Due to its structural design, capitalism will always pit business owners and investors against the working class. Capitalists also compete with each other, thus seeking to increase profits by reducing costs (including labor costs). Meanwhile, workers seek higher wages, fairer treatment, and better working conditions. These two sets of incentives are fundamentally opposed to each other, leading to class conflict.

## Are Capitalism and Free Enterprise the Same?

Capitalism and free enterprise are often viewed as synonymous. In fact, they are closely related but distinct terms with overlapping characteristics. It's possible to have a capitalist economy without complete free enterprise, and a free market without capitalism. Any economy is capitalist as long as the means of production are privately controlled. However, a capitalist system can still be regulated by government laws, and the profits of capitalist endeavors can still be heavily taxed. "Free enterprise" can be roughly understood as economic exchange free from coercive government influence.

## Bottom Line

Capitalism is an economic and political system in which trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit. Its core principles are accumulation, ownership, and profiting from capital. In its purest form, capitalism works best when these private owners are confident that the wealth they generate will remain in their own pockets, which is often a contentious proposition.

Capitalism is the world's dominant economic system, although it rarely exists in its pure form. In many countries, intervention from the state (a core feature of socialism) is common. Businesses are able to pursue profits within boundaries set by government. Most political theorists and nearly all economists believe that capitalism is the most efficient and productive system of exchange.
