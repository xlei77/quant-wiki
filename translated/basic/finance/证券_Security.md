## What is a Security?

The term "security" refers to various types of investments, such as stocks, bonds, investment contracts, notes, and derivatives. For example, securities can represent ownership in a company in the form of stocks, creditor relationships with government entities or corporations in the form of bonds, or ownership rights in the form of options.

### Key Points

- Securities are interchangeable and tradable financial instruments used to raise capital in public and private markets.
- There are three main types of securities: equity - which provides ownership to holders; debt - essentially loans repaid with periodic payments; and hybrid - which combines aspects of both debt and equity.
- Public offerings of securities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
- Self-regulatory organizations such as NASD, NFA, and FINRA also play important roles in regulating derivative securities.

## Understanding Securities

The Securities Act of 1933 was the first federal legislation to regulate the U.S. stock market, which was previously regulated at the state level. Under this law, anyone wishing to sell investment contracts to the public must disclose certain information about the proposed offering, the issuing company, and its key figures.

These requirements are designed to protect the investing public from deceptive or misleading marketing practices. Companies and their key officers bear strict liability for any inaccuracies in their financial statements, whether intentional or not. Subsequent legislation created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for oversight and enforcement.

Although the term "securities" is commonly associated with stocks, bonds, and similar instruments, the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the term more broadly. In SEC v. Howey (1946), the court ruled that the plaintiff's sale of land and agricultural services constituted an "investment contract" - even without any trace of stocks or bonds.

The case established the four-element Howey test, which states that an investment can be regulated as a security if the following conditions are met:

Under this rule, it doesn't matter whether a securities offering is formalized in legal contracts or stock certificates; any type of investment offering can be a security. On multiple occasions, courts have enforced securities provisions on unconventional assets such as whiskey, beavers, and chinchillas. The SEC has also sought enforcement against issuers of cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens.

## Types of Securities

Securities can be broadly divided into two different types: equity and debt. However, some hybrid securities combine elements of both equity and debt.

Equity securities represent ownership interests held by shareholders in an entity (corporation, partnership, or trust), implemented in the form of capital stock, which includes common stock and preferred stock.

Holders of equity securities typically have no right to periodic payments—although equity securities usually pay dividends—but they can profit from capital gains when selling the securities (assuming their value has increased).

Equity securities do confer proportional control of the company to holders through voting rights. In the event of bankruptcy, they share in residual equity only after all obligations to creditors have been paid. They are sometimes offered in the form of payment in kind.

Debt securities represent borrowings that must be repaid, with terms specifying the loan size, interest rate, and maturity or renewal date.

Debt securities, including government and corporate bonds, certificates of deposit (CDs), and mortgage securities (such as CDOs and CMOs), typically entitle their holders to periodic interest payments and principal repayment (regardless of the issuer's performance), along with any other specified contractual rights (excluding voting rights).

They are typically issued with fixed terms that end when they can be redeemed by the issuer. Debt securities can be secured (backed by collateral) or unsecured, and if secured, can have contractual priority over other unsecured, subordinated debt in bankruptcy situations.

As their name suggests, hybrid securities combine some characteristics of both debt and equity securities.

Examples of hybrid securities include equity warrants (options issued by companies themselves that give shareholders the right to purchase stock at a specific price within a specific time frame), convertible bonds (bonds that can be converted into common stock of the issuing company), and preferred stock (corporate stock whose interest, dividend, or other capital return payments take priority over other shareholders).

**Important Note:** Although preferred stock is technically classified as an equity security, it is often treated as a debt security because it "behaves like a bond." Preferred stock offers a fixed dividend rate and is a popular instrument for income-seeking investors. They are essentially fixed-income securities.

Derivatives are financial contracts whose prices are determined by the value of certain underlying assets (such as stocks, bonds, or commodities). The most commonly traded derivatives include call options (which increase in value if the underlying asset appreciates) and put options (which increase in value when the underlying asset depreciates).

Asset-backed securities represent a portion of a large basket of similar assets, such as loans, leases, credit card debt, mortgages, or anything else that generates income. Over time, cash flows from these assets are pooled and distributed to different investors.

## How Securities Are Traded

Publicly traded securities are listed on stock exchanges, where issuers can seek listing of their securities and attract investors to trade by ensuring a liquid and regulated market. In recent years, informal electronic trading systems have become increasingly common, and securities are now often traded "over-the-counter," or directly between investors online or by telephone.

Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) represent a company's first large-scale sale of equity securities to the public. After an IPO, any new issuance of stock, while still sold in the primary market, is referred to as a secondary offering.

Alternatively, securities can be privately offered to a restricted and qualified group, known as private placement - an important distinction in both corporate law and securities regulation. Sometimes companies sell stock through a combination of public and private offerings.

In the secondary market (also known as the aftermarket), securities simply transfer as assets from one investor to another: shareholders can sell their securities to other investors in exchange for cash and/or capital gains.

Thus, the secondary market complements the primary market. The secondary market for privately placed securities is less liquid because they are not publicly traded and can only be transferred between qualified investors.

## Investment Securities

The entity creating securities for sale is called the issuer, while those who purchase them are, of course, investors. Generally, securities represent an investment and serve as a means for municipalities, corporations, and other business enterprises to raise new capital. Companies can generate substantial funds when going public, for example, by selling stocks in an Initial Public Offering (IPO).

City, state, or county governments can raise funds for specific projects by issuing municipal bonds. Depending on the institution's market demand or pricing structure, raising funds through securities might be a better option than financing through bank loans.

On the other hand, purchasing securities with borrowed money, known as buying on margin, is a popular investment technique. Essentially, companies can deliver title, in the form of cash or other securities, either at the outset or in default, to pay their debts or other obligations to another entity. These collateral arrangements have been growing recently, especially among institutional investors.

## Securities Regulation

In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates the public offering and sale of securities.

The public offering, sale, and trading of U.S. securities must be registered and filed with the state securities departments of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Self-regulatory organizations (SROs) in the brokerage industry typically also assume regulatory roles. Examples of self-regulatory organizations include the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

## Residual Securities

Residual securities are convertible securities—meaning they can be converted into another form, typically common stock. For example, convertible bonds are residual securities because they allow bondholders to convert the securities into common stock.

Preferred shares may also have convertible features. Companies might offer residual securities to attract investment capital when funding competition is intense.

When residual securities are converted or exercised, they increase the number of common shares currently in circulation. This can dilute the total equity and its price. Dilution also affects financial analysis metrics, such as earnings per share, as the company's earnings must be divided by a larger number of shares.

Conversely, when a public company takes steps to reduce its total number of outstanding shares, it is said that the company has consolidated these shares. The net effect of this move is to increase the value per share. This is typically done to attract more or larger investors, such as mutual funds.

## Other Types of Securities

Certificated securities refer to securities represented in physical, paper form. Securities can also be kept in a direct registration system, which records stocks in book-entry form. In other words, transfer agents maintain stocks on behalf of companies without the need for physical certificates.

Modern technology and policies have largely eliminated the need for certificates and the requirement for issuers to maintain complete securities registers. A system has been developed where issuers can deposit a single global certificate representing all outstanding securities with a universal depository known as the Depository Trust Company (DTC).

All securities traded through DTC are held in electronic form. It's important to note that there are no differences in shareholder or issuer rights or privileges between certificated and uncertificated securities.

Bearer securities are transferable and confer rights under the securities to shareholders. They move between investors, in some cases through endorsement and delivery. In terms of ownership nature, pre-electronic bearer securities were always divided, meaning each security constitutes a separate asset, legally distinct from other securities of the same issue.

According to market convention, divided security assets can be either fungible or (less commonly) non-fungible, meaning that in lending, borrowers can return either equivalent assets or the specific same assets at the end of the loan. In some cases, bearer securities can be used to aid tax evasion and thus may sometimes be viewed negatively by issuers, shareholders, and fiscal regulators. They are rare in the United States.

Registered securities carry the holder's name and other necessary details, maintained by the issuer in a register. Transfer of registered securities occurs through modifications to the register. Registered debt securities are always undivided, meaning the entire issue constitutes a single asset, with each security being part of the whole. Undivided securities are inherently fungible. Secondary market stocks are also always undivided.

Letter securities are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and cannot be sold publicly in the market. Letter securities—also known as restricted securities, letter stock, or letter bonds—are sold directly to investors by the issuer. The term derives from the SEC's requirement for a "letter of investment" from the purchaser, stating that the purchase is for investment purposes rather than for resale. These letters typically require SEC Form 4 when changing hands.

Cabinet securities are listed on major financial exchanges (such as the New York Stock Exchange) but trade inactively. Held by inactive investment groups, they are more likely to be bonds rather than stocks. "Cabinet" refers to where bond orders were historically stored off the trading floor. Cabinets typically maintain limit orders, and these orders are kept until they expire or are executed.

## Issuing Securities: Examples

Consider the case of XYZ, a successful startup interested in raising funds to stimulate its next phase of growth. Until now, ownership of the startup has been distributed between two founders. It has several options for obtaining funding. It can enter the public market by conducting an Initial Public Offering (IPO), or it can raise funds by offering its stock to investors in a private placement.

The former method allows the company to generate more capital but comes with high fees and disclosure requirements. In the latter method, shares trade in the secondary market without public scrutiny. However, both scenarios involve the distribution of stock, which dilutes the founders' shares and grants ownership to investors. This is an example of an equity security.

Next, consider a government interested in raising funds to revitalize its economy. It uses bonds (debt securities) to raise this amount, promising regular payments to coupon holders.

Finally, look at the case of startup ABC. It raises funds from private investors, including family and friends. The startup's founders offer their investors convertible notes, which convert into stock of the startup during later events. Most such events are financing events. The note is essentially a debt security because it is a loan provided by investors to the startup's founders.

In later stages, the note transforms into equity in the form of a predefined number of shares that give investors a portion of the company. This is an example of a hybrid security.

## What's the difference between stocks and securities?

Stocks, or equities, are a type of security. Each share of stock represents partial ownership in a publicly traded company, which may include rights to vote in the election of company directors or receive a portion of profits. There are many other types of securities, such as bonds, derivatives, and asset-backed securities.

## What are Marketable Securities?

Marketable securities refer to any type of stocks, bonds, or other securities that can be easily bought and sold on public exchanges. For example, stocks of listed companies can be traded on stock exchanges, and government bonds can be bought and sold in the bond market.

In contrast, non-marketable securities refer to securities that cannot be legally sold to the public. For example, stocks of unlisted companies can only be bought and sold under very limited circumstances.

## What are Treasury Bonds?

Treasury bonds are debt securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to raise funds for the government. Since these bonds are backed by the government, they are considered very low risk and ideal for risk-averse investors.

## Bottom Line

Securities represent the most common type of investment contracts. When saving for retirement, most people choose to invest a portion of their savings in equity or debt securities. These securities markets are also important for the overall market as they allow companies to raise capital from the public.
