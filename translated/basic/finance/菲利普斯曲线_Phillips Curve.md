## What is the Phillips Curve?

The Phillips Curve is an economic theory that posits a stable and inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. Proposed by William Phillips, it suggests that economic growth leads to inflation, which in turn should result in more employment and less unemployment.

The original concept of the Phillips Curve has been somewhat discredited due to the stagflation of the 1970s. Stagflation refers to a period when both inflation and unemployment rates were high.[1]2

### Key Points

- The Phillips Curve indicates an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment; higher inflation is associated with lower unemployment rates, and vice versa.
- The Phillips Curve was a concept used to guide macroeconomic policy in the 20th century, but was challenged during the stagflation period of the 1970s.
- Understanding the Phillips Curve from the perspective of consumer and worker expectations suggests that the relationship between inflation and unemployment may not hold in the long term, and possibly not even in the short term.

## Understanding the Phillips Curve

The concept behind the Phillips Curve suggests that changes in unemployment rates within an economy have predictable effects on price inflation. The inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation is depicted as a downward-sloping convex curve, with inflation on the Y-axis and unemployment on the X-axis. Rising inflation rates reduce unemployment, and vice versa. Alternatively, focusing on reducing unemployment also increases inflation, and vice versa. [3]

The 1960s perspective was that any fiscal stimulus would increase aggregate demand and trigger the following effects: increased labor demand, subsequent reduction in unemployed workers, companies raising wages to compete for and attract scarcer talent. Then, companies' wage costs increase, and companies pass these costs on to consumers in the form of price increases.

This belief system led many governments to adopt a "stop-go" strategy, which involved setting a target inflation rate and using fiscal and monetary policies to expand or contract the economy to achieve the target rate. However, with the emergence of stagflation in the 1970s, the stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment broke down, causing people to question the effectiveness of the Phillips Curve. [1]2

## Phillips Curve and Stagflation

Stagflation occurs when an economy experiences economic stagnation, high unemployment, and high price inflation simultaneously. This situation directly contradicts the theory behind the Phillips Curve. In the United States, stagflation didn't appear until the 1970s, when rising unemployment rates were not accompanied by decreasing inflation. [4] Between 1973 and 1975, the U.S. economy experienced six consecutive quarters of GDP decline while the inflation rate doubled. [5]

## Expectations and the Long-Run Phillips Curve

The phenomenon of stagflation and the breakdown of the Phillips Curve prompted economists to study more deeply the role of expectations in the relationship between unemployment and inflation. Since workers and consumers can adjust their expectations of future inflation rates based on current inflation and unemployment rates, the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment only holds in the short run.[2]

When central banks increase inflation rates to reduce unemployment, this may lead to an initial shift in the short-run Phillips Curve, but as workers and consumers adapt their inflation expectations to the new environment, the Phillips Curve itself may shift outward in the long run.

This situation is particularly thought to occur near the natural rate of unemployment or NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment), which essentially represents the normal rate of frictional and institutional unemployment in the economy. Therefore, in the long run, if expectations can adapt to changes in inflation rates, the long-run Phillips Curve resembles a vertical line at NAIRU; monetary policy only serves to raise or lower inflation rates after expectations adjust.[6]2

During periods of stagflation, workers and consumers might even begin to rationally expect inflation rates to rise as soon as they realize that monetary authorities plan to implement expansionary monetary policy. This could cause the short-run Phillips Curve to shift outward even before expansionary monetary policy is implemented, thus making the policy's effect on reducing unemployment minimal even in the short run, effectively turning the short-run Phillips Curve into a vertical line at NAIRU as well.[2]

## Why Do Economists Still Believe in the Phillips Curve?

Although the Phillips Curve is not without limitations, some economists still consider it worthy of consideration.[7] Policymakers may use it as a general framework to think about the relationship between inflation and unemployment, both of which are key indicators of economic performance. Others warn that it fails to capture the complexity of today's markets.

## Why Are Ongoing Debates About the Phillips Curve Correlation Important?

Disagreements about the reliability of the Phillips Curve can lead to different economic policies. For example, a policymaker who believes that lower unemployment rates are associated with higher inflation rates might seek to implement measures to curb inflation, such as raising interest rates. [8] Another policymaker might disagree with this response.

## Why Has the Phillips Curve Flattened?

In certain periods, unemployment rates have declined even while inflation rates remained low, indicating that the Phillips Curve has "flattened." To some extent, this can be attributed to the Federal Reserve's concerted efforts to maintain low and stable inflation rates, which may have weakened the relationship between inflation and labor market performance.[9]

## Conclusion

The Phillips Curve is an economic theory that posits an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment. It resonated with economists in the 20th century but became increasingly controversial in the 1970s when unemployment and inflation rates rose simultaneously. Today, economists have adopted new models to explain the relationship between unemployment and inflation. However, some economists still maintain that, despite its limitations, the Phillips Curve is worth considering.
