## What is Keynesian Economics?

Keynesian economics is a macroeconomic theory that studies total expenditure in the economy and its effects on output, employment, and inflation. It was developed by British economist John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s in response to the impacts of the Great Depression.

The core belief of Keynesian economics is that government intervention can stabilize the economy. Keynes's theory was the first to explicitly distinguish between the study of economic behavior and individual incentives from the study of broad aggregate variables and structures.

Based on his theory, Keynes advocated for increased government spending and lower taxes to stimulate demand and pull the global economy out of depression.

Subsequently, Keynesian economics came to refer to the concept that optimal economic performance and prevention of economic recessions can be achieved through government intervention in aggregate demand.

Keynesian economists believe that such intervention can achieve full employment and price stability.

## Understanding Keynesian Economics

Keynesian economics represents a new way of viewing spending, output, and inflation. Previously, classical economic thought held that cyclical fluctuations in employment and economic output created profit opportunities that individuals and entrepreneurs were incentivized to pursue. By doing so, they would correct imbalances in the economy.

According to Keynes's view of this so-called classical theory, if aggregate demand in the economy fell, the resulting weakness in production and employment would lead to declines in prices and wages. Lower inflation and wage levels would induce employers to make capital investments and hire more people, thereby stimulating employment and restoring economic growth.[1]

However, Keynes argued that the depth and persistence of the Great Depression severely tested this assumption.[1]

In his work "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money" and other writings, Keynes opposed this construction of classical theory, asserting that during economic downturns, business pessimism and certain features of market economies would amplify economic weakness and cause aggregate demand to fall even further than it already had.[1]

For instance, Keynesian economics refuted the view held by some economists that reducing wages could restore full employment because the labor demand curve slopes downward like any other normal demand curve.[1]

Similarly, poor business conditions might lead companies to reduce capital investment rather than take advantage of lower prices to invest in new plants and equipment. This would also serve to reduce overall spending and employment.[2]

## Keynesian Economics and the Great Depression

Keynesian economics is sometimes called "depression economics" because Keynes' "General Theory" was written during a period of deep depression—not only in his home country of Britain but throughout the world.

This famous 1936 book was influenced by Keynes' understanding of events during the Great Depression, which he believed could not be explained by classical economic theory, as he described in the book.

Other economists had argued that after a general economic downturn, businesses and investors pursuing their self-interest with lower input prices would restore output and prices to equilibrium unless prevented from doing so. Keynes believed that the Great Depression seemed to contradict this theory.

During this period, output remained low and unemployment rates stayed high. The Great Depression inspired Keynes to think about the nature of the economy differently. From these theories, he developed real-world applications that could impact societies in economic crisis.

Keynes rejected the view that the economy would return to a natural equilibrium state. Instead, he believed that once an economic downturn begins, for whatever reason, the fear and pessimism it generates among businesses and investors often becomes self-fulfilling and can lead to sustained periods of depressed economic activity and unemployment.

To address this, Keynes advocated for counter-cyclical fiscal policy, meaning that during economic hardship, governments should engage in deficit spending to offset decreased investment and stimulate consumer spending, thereby stabilizing aggregate demand.[2]

Keynes was highly critical of the British government of the time.[3] The government had significantly increased welfare spending and raised taxes to balance national accounts. Keynes said this would not encourage people to spend money, thus preventing the economy from being stimulated and recovering to a successful state.

Keynes also criticized the notion of excessive saving, except for specific purposes such as retirement or education. He considered this dangerous for the economy because more stagnant money meant less money stimulating growth in the economy.[4] This view related to another of Keynes' theories aimed at preventing deep economic depressions.

Many economists criticized Keynes' approach. They argued that businesses responding to economic incentives would typically restore the economy to equilibrium unless prevented from doing so by government intervention in prices and wages, making markets appear self-regulating.

On the other hand, Keynes was writing during a period when the world was in a prolonged deep economic depression, and he was less optimistic about natural market equilibrium. He believed that government had advantages over market forces in creating a strong economy.

**Note:** Keynes recommended that governments increase spending and cut taxes, which would increase consumer demand in the economy. This, in turn, would lead to increased overall economic activity and lower unemployment rates.[2]

## Keynesian Economics and Fiscal Policy

The multiplier effect, proposed by Keynes' student Richard Kahn, is one of the main components of Keynesian countercyclical fiscal policy.

According to Keynes' fiscal stimulus theory, the injection of government spending would ultimately lead to increased business activity and even more spending. The theory suggests that spending increases total output and generates more income. If workers are willing to spend their additional income, the resulting GDP growth might even be larger than the initial stimulus amount.[5]

The magnitude of the Keynesian multiplier is directly related to the marginal propensity to consume. Consumer spending becomes income for businesses, which they then use for equipment, worker wages, energy, materials, purchased services, taxes, and investor returns. Workers' income can subsequently be spent, and the cycle continues.

Keynes and his followers believed that individuals should reduce savings and increase spending, raising their marginal propensity to consume, to achieve full employment and economic growth.

Keynes' fiscal stimulus theory dominated academic economics for decades. However, eventually, other economists, including Milton Friedman and Murray Rothbard, demonstrated that the Keynesian model incorrectly described the relationship between savings, investment, and economic growth.[6] Many economists still rely on multiplier-generated models, though most acknowledge that fiscal stimulus is far less effective than the original multiplier model suggested.

The fiscal multiplier commonly associated with Keynesian theory is one of two broad multipliers in economics. The other multiplier is known as the money multiplier. This multiplier refers to the money creation process generated by the fractional reserve banking system.[7] The money multiplier is less controversial than its Keynesian fiscal counterpart.

**Note:** According to the multiplier effect, every dollar spent in fiscal stimulus ultimately creates more than a dollar of growth. This appeared to be a coup for government economists, who could now justify politically popular spending programs nationwide.

## Keynesian Economics and Monetary Policy

Keynesian economics focuses on demand-side solutions during periods of recession. Government intervention in economic processes is a crucial component of the Keynesian arsenal against unemployment, underemployment, and low economic demand. The emphasis on direct government intervention in the economy often puts Keynesian theorists in conflict with those who advocate limited government participation in markets.

Keynesians believe that wages and employment respond slowly to market demand and require government intervention to maintain normal functioning. Furthermore, they argue that prices react slowly and only change gradually when monetary policy interventions occur, giving rise to a branch of Keynesian economics known as monetarism.[8]

If prices change slowly, this makes it possible to use the money supply as a tool and encourage borrowing through interest rate changes. Lowering interest rates is one way the government can meaningfully intervene in the economic system, thereby encouraging consumption and investment spending.[8]

The short-term demand growth triggered by interest rate cuts can revitalize the economic system and restore employment and service demand. New economic activity subsequently promotes sustained growth and employment.[2]

Keynesian theorists argue that without intervention, this cycle would be interrupted, market growth would become more unstable, and prone to excessive fluctuations. Maintaining low interest rates is an attempt to stimulate the economic cycle by encouraging businesses and individuals to borrow more money. They then spend the money they borrowed. This new spending stimulates the economy. However, lowering interest rates does not always directly lead to economic improvement.

Monetarist economists focus on managing the money supply and lowering interest rates as solutions to economic difficulties, but they typically try to avoid the zero lower bound problem. As interest rates approach zero, stimulating the economy through rate cuts becomes less effective because it reduces the incentive to invest rather than simply holding funds in cash or near-cash alternatives such as short-term government bonds.[9]

If interest rate manipulation cannot stimulate investment, it may no longer be sufficient to generate new economic activity, and attempts to produce economic recovery may stall completely. This is a liquidity trap.

When lowering interest rates fails to produce results, Keynesian economists believe other strategies must be employed, primarily fiscal policy. Other interventionist policies include direct control of labor supply, changing tax rates to indirectly increase or decrease the money supply, altering monetary policy, or controlling the supply of goods and services until employment and demand recover.[2]

**Important Note:** Keynesian theorists believe that economies do not stabilize quickly and require active intervention to promote short-term demand in the economy.[8]

## Keynesian Economics and the 2007-08 Financial Crisis

In response to the Great Recession and financial crisis of 2007-2008, Congress and the executive branch implemented several measures that drew from Keynesian economic theory. The federal government bailed out debt-laden companies across multiple industries, including banks, insurance companies, and automobile manufacturers.

It also placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two major market makers and guarantors of mortgages and home loans, under conservatorship.

In 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, an $831 billion government stimulus package designed to save existing jobs and create new ones. It included tax cuts, credits, and unemployment benefits for families; it also designated spending for healthcare, infrastructure, and education.

These stimulus measures and federal interventions helped the U.S. economy recover and prevented the Great Recession from evolving into another full-scale depression.

## Who is John Maynard Keynes?

John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) was a British economist, best known as the founder of Keynesian economics and the pioneer of modern macroeconomics. Keynes studied at King's College, Cambridge, one of Britain's most elite schools, where he earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1905. [3] He was skilled in mathematics but had received little formal training in economics.

## How does Keynesian Economics Differ from Classical Economics?

According to Keynes, classical economics holds that fluctuations in employment and economic output create profit opportunities that individuals and entrepreneurs are motivated to pursue, ultimately correcting imbalances in the economy.[4]

In contrast, Keynes believed that during economic recessions, business pessimism and certain features of market economies would amplify economic weakness and lead to further declines in aggregate demand. Keynesian economics argues that during such difficult periods, the government should undertake deficit spending to offset falling investment and stimulate consumer spending, thereby stabilizing aggregate demand.[2]

## What is Monetarism?

Monetarism is a macroeconomic theory which states that governments can promote economic stability by controlling the rate of money supply growth. Monetarism is closely associated with economist Milton Friedman and is a branch of Keynesian economics that emphasizes the use of monetary policy rather than fiscal policy to manage aggregate demand, contrasting with the theories of most Keynesian economists.[8]

## Bottom Line

John Maynard Keynes and Keynesian economics were revolutionary in the 1930s and largely shaped the economy of the mid-20th century after World War II. His theories came under attack in the 1970s, made a comeback in the 2000s of the 21st century, and remain controversial to this day.

Keynesian economics recognizes the government's role in stimulating aggregate demand. For example, federal spending and tax cuts put more money in people's pockets, which can stimulate demand and investment.

Unlike free-market economists, Keynesian economics welcomes limited government intervention and stimulus during economic downturns.
