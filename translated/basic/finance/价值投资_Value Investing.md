## What is Value Investing?

Value investing is an investment strategy that involves selecting stocks that appear to be trading below their intrinsic value or book value. Value investors actively seek stocks they believe are undervalued by the market. They believe that the market overreacts to both good and bad news, resulting in stock price movements that do not correspond to a company's long-term fundamentals. This overreaction provides profit opportunities to purchase stocks at discounted prices.

Warren Buffett is perhaps the most famous value investor today, but there are many others, including Benjamin Graham (Buffett's professor and mentor), David Dodd, Charlie Munger (Buffett's business partner), Christopher Browne (another student of Graham), and billionaire hedge fund manager Seth Klarman.

### Key Points

- Value investing is an investment strategy that selects stocks trading below their intrinsic or book value.
- Value investors actively seek stocks they believe are undervalued by the market.
- Value investors use financial analysis, avoid following the crowd, and focus on long-term holdings in quality companies.

## Understanding Value Investing

The basic concept of value investing is relatively simple: if you know the true value of something, you can save a lot of money when purchasing it. Most people would agree that whether you buy a new television at a discount or full price, you're getting the same TV with the same screen size and picture quality.

Stock prices work similarly, meaning that a company's stock price can change even if the company's valuation remains constant. Strictly speaking, there is no true or intrinsic value for a company's stock. However, there is relative value.

Market participants can buy and sell stocks without being constrained by objective price figures. Therefore, like televisions, stocks experience peaks and troughs in demand, leading to price fluctuations. If a company's fundamentals remain unchanged and future opportunities remain the same, the stock's value is essentially the same, despite different prices.

**Important Note**: Value investing originated from concepts introduced by Columbia Business School professors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in 1934, and was popularized in Graham's 1949 book "The Intelligent Investor."

Just as savvy shoppers would argue that paying full price for a television is pointless because TVs go on sale multiple times throughout the year, astute value investors believe stocks work the same way. Of course, unlike televisions, stocks don't go on sale during predictable periods each year, and their price reductions aren't widely advertised.

Value investing is the process of investigating these secret stock sales and purchasing them at prices below their market value. By holding these value stocks for the long term, investors can achieve substantial returns.

## Intrinsic Value and Value Investing

In the stock market, the equivalent of a stock being cheap or discounted is that its shares are undervalued. Value investors seek to profit from shares they believe are deeply discounted.

Investors use various metrics to find a stock's valuation or intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is determined through a combination of financial analyses, such as examining a company's financial performance, revenue, earnings, cash flow, profits, and fundamentals. It includes the company's brand, business model, target market, and competitive advantages. Some metrics used to evaluate company stocks include:

- Price-to-Book ratio (P/B), used to measure the value of company assets and compare it to the stock price. If the price is below the value of assets, assuming the company is not in financial distress, then the stock is undervalued.
- Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E), used to show a company's earnings record to determine if the stock price fails to reflect all earnings or is undervalued.
- Free Cash Flow, which is the cash generated by a company from revenue or operations after deducting expenditure costs.

Free cash flow is the cash remaining after paying expenses, including operating costs and capital expenditures (i.e., large purchases such as equipment or manufacturing plant upgrades). If a company generates free cash flow, it will have surplus funds to invest in the business's future, pay down debt, pay dividends, or buy back stock.

Of course, there are many other metrics used for analysis, including debt, equity, sales, and revenue growth analyses. After reviewing these metrics, value investors can decide to purchase stocks if they find the comparative value—the relationship between the stock's current price and its intrinsic value—sufficiently attractive.

## Margin of Safety

Value investors need to allow for some margin of error when estimating value, and typically set a "margin of safety" based on their risk tolerance. The margin of safety principle is one of the keys to successful value investing, based on the premise that buying stocks at a low price increases your chances of profiting when you sell in the future. A margin of safety also reduces the risk of potential losses if the stock doesn't perform as expected.

Therefore, if you believe a stock is worth $100 and buy it at $66, you only need to wait for the stock price to rise to its true value of $100 to earn a $34 profit. Additionally, company growth and value appreciation may bring you even higher returns. If the stock price rises to $110, your profit will be $44 because you bought at a discount. If you had purchased at $100, your profit would only be $10.

**Note:** Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, recommended buying stocks when their price is at or below two-thirds of their liquidation value. This was his recommended margin of safety for minimizing risk and achieving optimal returns.[1]

## Value Investors Don't Believe in Market Efficiency

Value investors don't believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which suggests that stock prices already reflect all information about a company and therefore their prices always reflect their value. Instead, value investors believe that stocks can be overvalued or undervalued for various reasons.

For example, stocks might be undervalued due to poor economic performance and panic selling by investors (as was the case during the Great Recession). Or stocks might be overvalued due to investor excitement about unproven new technologies (as during the Internet bubble). Psychological biases can drive stock price fluctuations based on news (such as disappointing or unexpected earnings announcements, product recalls, or lawsuits).

## Value Investors Don't Follow the Crowd

Value investors possess many characteristics of contrarian investors—they don't follow the mainstream. They not only reject the Efficient Market Hypothesis but also tend to sell or stay on the sidelines when others are buying. When others are selling, they are buying or holding. Value investors don't purchase popular stocks (because they are usually overvalued). Instead, they choose less well-known companies, as long as their financial conditions meet their criteria. When well-known stocks experience significant price drops, they will also re-examine these stocks, believing that if the fundamentals remain strong, they may recover from setbacks, and quality remains intact.

Value investors only focus on the intrinsic value of stocks. They believe that buying stocks represents a percentage ownership in a company, and they want to own companies they know have reliable principles and sound finances, regardless of what others are saying or doing.

## Value Investing Requires Diligence and Patience

Estimating a stock's true intrinsic value involves not only financial analysis but also considerable subjectivity—meaning it's sometimes more of an art than a science. Two different investors can analyze the exact same valuation data for a company and reach different conclusions. Therefore, you need to develop a strategy that works for you.

Some investors focus only on existing financial conditions, placing less emphasis on future growth estimates. Other value investors primarily focus on a company's future growth potential and projected cash flows. Some do both: famous value investing experts Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch (who managed Fidelity's Magellan Fund for many years) are known for analyzing financial statements and examining valuation multiples to identify mispriced stocks in the market.

Despite different approaches, the basic logic of value investing is to purchase assets at prices below their current value, hold them long-term, and profit when they recover to or exceed their intrinsic value. It doesn't offer instant gratification. You can't expect to buy a stock for $50 on Tuesday and sell it for $100 on Thursday. Instead, you might need to wait several years to see returns on your stock investments, possibly experiencing occasional losses along the way. The good news is that for most investors, the tax rate on long-term capital gains is lower than that on short-term investment gains.

Like all investment strategies, you must have patience and diligence to stick to your investment philosophy. Some stocks might attract you due to strong fundamentals, but if the price is too high, patience is needed to wait. You want to buy stocks at the most attractive prices, and if no stocks meet your criteria, then you must wait quietly, letting your funds sit idle until opportunities arise.

## Why Stocks Become Undervalued

If you don't believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis, you can identify reasons why stocks trade below their intrinsic value. Here are some factors that can cause stock prices to fall and become undervalued.

Sometimes, people make irrational investment decisions based on psychological biases rather than market fundamentals. They buy when specific stock prices rise or when the overall market is up. They see that if they had invested 12 weeks ago, they could have earned a 15% return, and subsequently develop a fear of missing out.

Conversely, when stock prices fall or the overall market declines, loss aversion drives people to sell stocks. Thus, rather than waiting for the market direction to change while maintaining paper losses, they prefer to accept specific losses and sell. This investor behavior is so common that it affects individual stock prices, amplifies market upward and downward trends, and creates excessive volatility.

"Bubbles" are the result of investor enthusiasm where prices continuously rise. When markets reach incredible highs, it usually leads to the bubble bursting. As price levels become unsustainable, investors eventually panic and sell off the related assets. This leads to market crashes. This happened with the internet bubble in the early 2000s, when tech stocks were valued far above companies' actual worth. We saw the same thing happen in 2006 when the real estate bubble burst and markets crashed in the following years.

Look beyond what you hear in the news. You might find truly good investment opportunities in smaller stocks that aren't widely followed or even in foreign stocks. Most investors want to participate in the next hot thing, like tech startups, rather than boring, mature consumer goods manufacturers.

For example, stocks like Meta (formerly Facebook), Apple, and Google are more likely to be affected by collective investment mentality, while conglomerates like Procter & Gamble or Johnson & Johnson are less affected.

Even excellent companies face setbacks, such as lawsuits and recalls. However, just because a company experiences one adverse event doesn't mean it still doesn't have intrinsic value or its stock won't bounce back. In other cases, there might be a segment or division affecting the company's profitability. But if the company decides to dispose of or close that business unit, this situation might change.

Analysts aren't great at predicting the future, yet investors often panic and sell when a company's earnings fall below analyst expectations. However, value investors who can see beyond downgraded forecasts and negative news can buy stocks at deeper discounts because they can identify the company's long-term value.

Cyclicality is defined as fluctuations that affect business. Companies are not immune to economic cycles, whether seasonal factors or consumer attitudes and sentiments. All of this can affect profit levels and a company's stock price, but not the company's long-term value.

## Value Investment Strategy

The key to buying undervalued stocks lies in thorough company research and making rational decisions. Value investor Christopher H. Brown suggests asking whether a company can increase its revenue through:

- Raising product prices
- Increasing sales
- Reducing expenses
- Selling or closing unprofitable divisions[2]

Brown also recommends studying a company's competitors to evaluate its future growth prospects. However, the answers to all these questions are often speculative and lack substantial data support. Simply put, there is currently no quantitative software program that can help derive these answers, making value investing sometimes more like a game of educated guessing. Therefore, Warren Buffett suggests investing only in industries you have personal experience with or consumer goods you're familiar with, such as cars, clothing, appliances, and food.

Investors can choose stocks of companies that sell products and services in high demand. While it's difficult to predict when innovative new products will capture market share, it's easy to evaluate how long a company has been operating and study how it has responded to challenges.

Here, insiders refer to company senior executives and directors, as well as any shareholders who own at least 10% of the company's shares.[3] Company officers and directors possess unique knowledge about the companies they operate, so if they are buying company stock, it's reasonable to assume that the company's prospects look promising.

Similarly, investors holding at least 10% of shares wouldn't buy such large stakes without seeing profit potential. Conversely, insider selling doesn't necessarily indicate expected poor company performance—insiders might simply need cash for personal reasons. However, if insiders are selling in large volumes, the situation may warrant further in-depth analysis.

At some point, value investors must examine the company's financial reports to understand its performance and compare it with industry peers.

Financial reports show the company's annual and quarterly performance results. The annual report is SEC Form 10-K, and quarterly reports are SEC Form 10-Q. Companies must file these reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).[4] You can find these reports on the SEC website or on the company's website's investor relations page.[5]

Much can be learned from a company's annual report. It will explain the products and services offered, as well as the company's direction of development.

## Financial Statements

Financial statements are typically included in financial reports submitted by companies to regulatory authorities, but they provide a panoramic view of a company's financial position. Listed companies are required to submit three statements—the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.

The balance sheet consists of two parts, one section listing the company's assets and the other showing its liabilities and shareholders' equity. The assets section is broken down into the company's cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable (money owed by customers), inventory, and fixed assets such as plants and equipment.

The liabilities section shows the company's accounts payable or debts, accrued liabilities, short-term debt, and long-term debt. The shareholders' equity section reflects the total amount invested in the company, the number of shares outstanding, and the amount of retained earnings. Retained earnings is a savings account that stores the company's accumulated profits, for example for paying dividends, and is seen as a sign of healthy company profitability.

The income statement shows the revenue generated, company expenses, and profits. Looking at annual income statements rather than quarterly statements will give a better understanding of the company's overall condition, as many companies experience sales fluctuations throughout the year.

The cash flow statement shows where the company's cash comes from and where it goes. It tells you which activities generate inflows, such as operating, investing, or financing activities. It also shows which activities produce outflows.

**Important Note**: Research shows that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the overall market in the long term.

## Couch Potato Investing

It is possible to be a value investor without reading 10-K reports. Couch potato investing is an actively managed passive investment strategy that involves buying and holding investment vehicles where someone else has done the investment analysis—namely mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. In the case of value investing, these funds track value strategies and buy value stocks—or track the movements of high-profile value investors like Warren Buffett.

Investors can purchase shares in his holding company Berkshire Hathaway, which owns or has stakes in many companies that have been researched and evaluated by the "Oracle of Omaha."

## Risks of Value Investing

Like any investment strategy, although value investing is a low to medium-risk strategy, there are still risks of losses. Here are some risks and reasons why losses may occur.

Many investors use financial statements when making value investment decisions. Therefore, if you rely on your own analysis, it's crucial to ensure you have the latest information and your calculations are accurate. If not, you might make poor investments or miss good opportunities. If you're not yet confident in reading and analyzing financial statements and reports, continue learning these subjects and don't make any trades before you're truly ready.

One strategy is to read the notes. These are annotations in Forms 10-K or 10-Q that further explain a company's financial statements. These notes follow the statements, explaining the company's accounting methods and elaborating on the reported results. If the notes are difficult to understand, or if the information they provide seems unreasonable, you'll have a clearer indication of whether to pass on the stock.

Some items that appear on a company's income statement should be considered exceptional or special. These are usually beyond the company's control and are called extraordinary items—gains or extraordinary items—losses. Examples include litigation, restructuring, or even natural disasters. If you exclude these in your analysis, you can get a rough idea of the company's future performance.

However, think critically about these items and use your judgment. If a company reports the same extraordinary items every year, this might indicate they're not so "extraordinary." Moreover, if there are unexpected losses every year, this could be a sign of financial problems. Extraordinary items should be irregular and one-time occurrences. Also, be wary of recurring impairments.

Earlier tutorial sections discussed calculations of various financial ratios that help investors diagnose a company's financial health. There's no single way to determine financial ratios, which can be quite tricky. The following factors may affect ratio interpretation:

- Ratios can be calculated using pre-tax or post-tax figures.
- Some ratios may yield inaccurate results, leading to estimates.
- Company earnings per share (EPS) may vary depending on how "earnings" is defined.
- Comparing different companies can be troublesome even with identical ratios due to different accounting practices.

Paying too much for stocks is one of the primary risks for value investors. If you pay too high a price, you risk losing part or all of your capital. Buying stocks close to fair market value carries the same risk. Buying undervalued stocks means your risk of loss is reduced even if the company performs poorly.

Recall that one of the fundamental principles of value investing is establishing a margin of safety in all investments. This means buying stocks at two-thirds or less of their intrinsic value. Value investors aim to risk as little capital as possible in potentially overvalued assets, so they try not to overpay for investments.

Traditional investment wisdom suggests that investing in individual stocks can be a high-risk strategy. Instead, we're taught to invest in multiple stocks or stock indices to gain exposure to various companies and economic sectors. However, some value investors believe you can have a diversified portfolio even with just a few stocks, as long as you choose stocks representing different industries and economic sectors. Value investor and investment manager Christopher H. Browne suggests owning at least 10 stocks.[6] According to Benjamin Graham, if you want to diversify your holdings, consider selecting 10 to 30 stocks.[7]

However, another group of experts holds a different view. If you want high returns, try selecting few stocks, according to the authors of "The Little Book of Value Investing, Second Edition." They suggest that having more stocks in your portfolio might lead to average returns.[8] Of course, this advice assumes you're excellent at picking winners, which is particularly challenging for beginners.

It's difficult to ignore emotions when making investment decisions. Even if you can take a cool, critical stance when evaluating data, fear and excitement may be hard to avoid when using hard-earned money to buy stocks. More importantly, once you've bought stocks, you might be tempted to sell them if prices fall.

Remember, the key to value investing is resisting the temptation to panic and not following the crowd. Therefore, don't fall into the trap of buying when prices rise and selling when they fall. This behavior will destroy your investment returns (following the crowd can quickly become a dangerous game).

## Value Investing Examples

Value investors seek to profit from market overreactions, which often occur after quarterly earnings releases. As a real historical example, on May 4, 2016, Fitbit released its Q1 2016 earnings report and experienced a sharp decline in after-hours trading. Following this fluctuation, the company lost nearly 19% of its market value. However, while significant stock price drops after earnings releases are not uncommon, Fitbit not only met analysts' expectations for the quarter but also raised its guidance for 2016.[9]

The company achieved revenue of $505.4 million in Q1 2016, representing year-over-year growth of over 50%. Additionally, Fitbit projected revenue of $565 million to $585 million for Q2 2016, exceeding analysts' expectations of $531 million.[9]

The company's outlook was strong and growing. However, due to Fitbit's heavy investment in R&D during the first quarter, earnings per share (EPS) decreased compared to the previous year. This was sufficient to trigger selling by ordinary investors, leading to the stock price decline. However, a value investor focused on fundamentals understood that Fitbit was an undervalued security with enormous potential.

As a case in point—in 2019, Fitbit's revenue exceeded $1.4 billion; subsequently, in 2021, Google ultimately acquired Fitbit for $2.1 billion.[10][11] Value investors who purchased Fitbit stock at the undervalued price of $5.35 on February 9, 2017, would have performed well, as the stock was converted to cash at $7.35 per share, paid to investors at the time of acquisition.[12][13]

## What is Value Investing?

Value investing is an investment philosophy that involves purchasing assets at a discount to their intrinsic value. This is also known as the margin of safety. Benjamin Graham, known as the father of value investing, first introduced this term in his seminal 1949 work "The Intelligent Investor." Notable proponents of value investing include Warren Buffett, Seth Klarman, Mohnish Pabrai, and Joel Greenblatt.

## What are examples of value investing?

Common sense and fundamental analysis form the foundation of many value investing principles. The margin of safety, which refers to the discount of a stock relative to its intrinsic value, is one of the main principles. For example, fundamental indicators such as the Price-to-Earnings ratio (PE) show the relationship between a company's earnings and its price. Value investors might invest in companies with lower PE ratios, as this provides a criterion for judging whether they are undervalued or overvalued.

## What are the Common Value Investment Indicators?

In addition to analyzing a company's Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, other common indicators include Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, Free Cash Flow (FCF), and Debt-to-Equity (D/E) ratio.

## Who is "Mr. Market"?

The term "Mr. Market" was first introduced by Benjamin Graham, representing a hypothetical investor who is prone to emotional swings including fear, indifference, and euphoria. "Mr. Market" embodies the consequences of emotional reactions to the stock market, rather than rational or fundamental analysis. As a behavioral archetype, "Mr. Market" reflects the inherent price fluctuations in the market and the extreme emotions that can influence these fluctuations, such as greed and fear.

## Conclusion

Value investing is a long-term strategy. For example, Warren Buffett buys stocks with the intention of holding them almost indefinitely. He has said: "I never try to make money on the stock market. I buy on the assumption that they could close the market tomorrow and not reopen it for five years."

You might want to sell stocks when you need to make major purchases or retire, but by holding multiple stocks and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can sell stocks when their prices exceed their fair market value (and your purchase price).

Correction — February 8, 2024: This article has been corrected to indicate that Benjamin Graham recommended buying stocks when their price is at or below two-thirds of their liquidation value.
