## What is Liquidity?

Liquidity refers to how efficiently or easily an asset or security can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. Among all assets, cash itself has the highest liquidity. Therefore, the availability of cash for such conversions is the most significant factor affecting whether a market can function effectively.

The higher the liquidity of an asset, the easier and more efficient it is to convert it back to cash. Assets with poor liquidity require more time and may incur higher costs.

### Key Points

- Liquidity refers to how efficiently or easily an asset or security can be converted into cash without affecting its market price.
- Cash is the most liquid asset, while tangible items have poor liquidity.
- The two main types of liquidity are market liquidity and accounting liquidity.
- The most commonly used liquidity ratios are the current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio.

## Understanding Liquidity

In other words, liquidity describes the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold in the market at a price reflecting its intrinsic value. Cash is generally considered the most liquid asset because it can be converted into other assets most quickly and easily. Tangible assets, such as real estate, art, and collectibles, are relatively illiquid. Other financial assets, from stocks to partnership units, fall at different points along the liquidity spectrum.[1]

For example, if someone wants a refrigerator worth $1,000, cash is the easiest asset to use to acquire it. If this person has no cash but owns a rare book collection valued at $1,000, they are unlikely to find someone willing to trade a refrigerator for their collection. Instead, they must sell these books and use the cash to buy the refrigerator.

If this person can wait several months or years to make the purchase, that might be fine, but if they only have a few days, it could be problematic. They might have to sell the books at a discount rather than wait for a buyer willing to pay full value. Rare books are an example of an illiquid asset.

**Note:** There are two main measures of liquidity: market liquidity and accounting liquidity.

Market liquidity refers to the degree to which a market (such as a country's stock market or a city's real estate market) allows assets to be bought and sold at stable, transparent prices. In the example above, the market liquidity for trading rare books for refrigerators is so poor that it essentially doesn't exist.[2]

On the other hand, stock markets are characterized by higher market liquidity. If an exchange has high trading volume and isn't dominated by sellers, the price buyers quote for each share (bid price) and the price sellers are willing to accept (ask price) will be very close.

Therefore, investors don't have to give up unrealized gains for a quick sale. Market liquidity is higher when the spread between bid and ask prices narrows; when spreads widen, markets become more illiquid. Real estate markets typically have far less liquidity than stock markets. The liquidity of other asset markets (such as derivatives, contracts, currencies, or commodities) typically depends on their size and how many public exchanges are available for trading.

Accounting liquidity measures how easily an individual or company can meet their financial obligations using their available liquid assets—that is, their ability to pay debts on time.

In the example above, the rare book collector's assets are relatively illiquid and might not be worth their full $1,000 value in an emergency. In investment terms, assessing accounting liquidity means comparing liquid assets to current liabilities (financial obligations due within one year).

There are several ratios that measure accounting liquidity, which differ in how strictly they define liquid assets. Analysts and investors use these ratios to identify companies with strong liquidity. It is also considered a measure of depth.

## Measuring Liquidity

Financial analysts focus on a company's ability to use liquid assets to repay its short-term debt. Generally, when using these formulas, ratios greater than 1 are considered ideal.

The Current Ratio is the simplest and least stringent. It measures the ratio of current assets (assets that can reasonably be converted to cash within one year) to current liabilities. The formula is:

The Quick Ratio, also known as the Acid Test Ratio, is slightly more stringent. It excludes inventory and other current assets that are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and short-term investments. The formula is:

A variant of the Quick Ratio/Acid Test Ratio simply subtracts inventory from current assets, making it slightly more lenient:

The Cash Ratio is the most stringent of the liquidity ratios. It excludes accounts receivable, as well as inventory and other current assets, strictly defining current assets as cash or cash equivalents.

Compared to the Current Ratio or Acid Test Ratio, the Cash Ratio better evaluates an entity's ability to maintain solvency in emergency (worst-case) situations—the reasoning being that even profitable companies can get into trouble if they don't have sufficient liquidity to respond to unforeseen events. Its formula is:[3]

## Liquidity Examples

In terms of investment, stocks as a category are among the most liquid assets. However, not all stocks or other interchangeable securities are equal in terms of liquidity. Some options and stocks trade more actively on securities exchanges than others. More activity means there's more market. In other words, they attract larger and more sustained interest from traders and investors.

**Note:** Beyond trading volume, other factors such as bid-ask spread width, market depth, and order book data can provide further insight into a stock's liquidity. Therefore, while trading volume is an important factor in assessing liquidity, it should not be relied upon exclusively.

These highly liquid stocks can typically be identified by their daily trading volume, which can reach millions or even billions of shares. When a stock has high trading volume, it means there are many buyers and sellers in the market, making it easier for investors to buy and sell the stock without significantly affecting its price. On the other hand, stocks with low trading volume may be harder to buy and sell due to fewer market participants, and thus have lower liquidity.

For example, on March 13, 2023, Amazon Corporation (AMZN) traded 69.60 million shares on the exchange. In comparison, Intel Corporation (INTC) had a trading volume of only 48.10 million shares, indicating slightly lower liquidity. However, Ford Motor Company (F) had a trading volume of 118.5 million shares, making it the most active among these three stocks that day and potentially the most liquid.[4]

## Why is Liquidity Important?

If a market lacks liquidity, it becomes difficult to sell or convert assets or securities into cash. For example, you might own a very rare and valuable family heirloom appraised at $150,000. However, if there is no market for your item (i.e., no buyers), then it doesn't matter because no one will pay anything close to its appraised value—it has very poor liquidity. It might even require hiring an auction house as a broker and tracking down potentially interested parties, which would take time and incur costs.

However, liquid assets can be easily and quickly sold at full value with minimal costs. Companies must also hold sufficient liquid assets to pay their short-term debts, such as bills or payroll; otherwise, they might face a liquidity crisis, which could lead to bankruptcy.

## What are the Most Liquid Assets or Securities?

Cash is the most liquid asset, followed by cash equivalents such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), or time deposits. Exchange-listed securities, such as stocks and bonds, are typically highly liquid and can be quickly sold through brokers. Gold coins and certain collectibles can also be easily sold for cash.

## What are Illiquid Assets or Securities?

Securities traded over-the-counter (OTC), such as certain complex derivatives, typically have poor liquidity. For individuals, assets like houses, timeshares, or cars are somewhat illiquid because it may take weeks to months to find buyers, and several more weeks to complete the transaction and receive payment. Additionally, brokerage fees are often quite high (for example, real estate broker fees typically range from 5% to 7%).

## Why Are Some Stocks More Liquid Than Others?

The most liquid stocks are typically those that attract significant interest from various market participants and have high daily trading volumes. These stocks also attract more market makers who maintain tighter two-way markets.

Stocks lacking liquidity have wider bid-ask spreads and less market depth. These stocks are often lesser-known, have lower trading volumes, and typically have lower market values and volatility. As a result, shares of a large multinational bank tend to be more liquid than those of a small regional bank.

## Conclusion

Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset or security can be converted into cash, with cash itself being the most liquid of all assets. Other liquid assets include stocks, bonds, and other exchange-traded securities. Tangible items tend to have lower liquidity, meaning they may require more time, effort, and cost to sell (for example, real estate).

Market liquidity and accounting liquidity are the two main categories of liquidity, and financial analysts use various ratios (such as current ratio, quick ratio, acid-test ratio, and cash ratio) to measure it. Having liquidity is crucial for individuals and companies to repay their short-term debts and obligations and avoid liquidity crises.
