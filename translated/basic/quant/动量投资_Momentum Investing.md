## What is Momentum Investing?

Momentum investing is a strategy that aims to capitalize on the continuation of existing market trends. In this trading strategy, investors buy securities that have already risen in price and sell them when they reach their peak.

In markets, momentum refers to the ability of a price trend to sustain itself moving forward.

### Key Points

- Momentum investing is a strategy aimed at capitalizing on the continuation of existing market trends.
- Market momentum is the ability of price trends to maintain and extend themselves.
- Momentum investing typically follows a strict set of rules based on technical indicators that determine entry and exit points for specific securities.
- Few professional investment managers use momentum investing, instead preferring to rely on fundamental factors and value indicators.

## Understanding Momentum Investing

Momentum investing involves taking long positions in stocks, futures, market ETFs, or any financial instruments showing upward price trends, while simultaneously taking short positions in corresponding assets whose prices are declining.

Momentum investing believes that trends can persist for a period of time, and it's possible to profit by continuously following a trend until it ends, regardless of how long this might take. For example, momentum investors who entered the U.S. stock market in 2009 typically benefited from the upward trend until December 2018.

**Note:** Although he wasn't the first to use this strategy, fund manager and trader Richard Driehaus is generally considered the pioneer of momentum investing.[1]

## Momentum Investment Methods

Momentum investing typically follows a strict set of rules based on technical indicators that determine market entry and exit points for specific securities.

Momentum investors sometimes use two longer-period moving averages (MA), with one slightly shorter than the other, to generate trading signals. For example, some use 50-day and 200-day MAs. In this case, a buy signal is generated when the 50-day line crosses above the 200-day line, while a sell signal is generated when the 50-day line crosses back below the 200-day line. Some momentum investors prefer using longer-term MAs for signals.

Another momentum investment strategy involves taking long positions in sector ETFs with the strongest momentum while simultaneously taking short positions in sector ETFs with the weakest momentum, then rotating between these sectors accordingly.

Other momentum strategies involve cross-asset analysis. For example, some stock traders closely monitor the Treasury yield curve and use it as a momentum signal for stock market entry and exit. A 10-year Treasury yield exceeding the 2-year yield is typically a buy signal, while a 2-year yield exceeding the 10-year yield is a sell signal. Notably, the spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields is often a strong predictor of recessions and affects the stock market.

Additionally, some strategies combine momentum factors with certain fundamental factors. One notable system is CAN SLIM, created by William O'Neill, which is known for emphasizing quarterly and annual earnings per share (EPS) growth.[2] While some might argue this isn't a true momentum strategy, the system typically seeks stocks with earnings and sales momentum, and tends to point to stocks that also exhibit price momentum.

**Important Note:** If you plan to practice momentum investing, ensure you select appropriate securities and consider their liquidity and trading volume.

Like other momentum systems, CAN SLIM also includes rules for entering and exiting stocks, primarily based on technical analysis.

## Momentum Investing Debate

Few professional investment managers use momentum investing, believing that stock selection based on discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and other fundamental factors often produces more predictable results and is a better way to outperform indices over the long term. As quoted in an article from the UCLA Anderson Review: "As an investment strategy, it represents a challenge to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), one of the core principles of modern finance."[3]

However, momentum investing has its supporters. A study published in the Journal of Finance in 1993 documented that strategies of buying recent winner stocks and selling recent loser stocks generated returns significantly above the overall U.S. market between 1965 and 1989.[4]

More recently, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) found that when examining data over the past five and ten years, CAN SLIM outperformed the S&P 500 index and showed excellent performance over longer time frames.[5]

## What Technical Indicators Can Momentum Traders Use?

In momentum trading, technical analysts can use several momentum indicators. Among the most popular are the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Rate of Change (ROC), Stochastics, and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).

## What is the formula for market momentum?

Typically, market momentum can be defined by the following formula:

$$ \begin{aligned} &M = V - V_x\\ &\textbf{其中:}\\ &V = \text{最新价格}\\ &V_x = \text{x天前的收盘价格} \\ \end{aligned} $$

## What is the Market Psychology Behind Momentum Trading?

Momentum traders benefit from herd mentality, greed, and fear of missing out. This can cause bull markets to rise beyond what fundamentals would predict. Similarly, fear of losses and panic can turn selling into crashes.
