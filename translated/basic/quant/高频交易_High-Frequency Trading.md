## What is High-Frequency Trading (HFT)?

High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is a trading method that uses powerful computer programs to execute large volumes of orders within milliseconds. HFT relies on complex algorithms to analyze multiple markets and execute orders based on market conditions.

Typically, traders with the fastest execution speeds are more profitable than slower traders. Another characteristic of HFT is high turnover rates and order-to-trade ratios.

### Key Points

- HFT is complex algorithmic trading where large numbers of orders are executed within seconds.
- HFT provides liquidity to markets and narrows bid-ask spreads.
- HFT is criticized for giving large companies an advantage in trading.
- Another complaint is that the liquidity generated by such trading is fleeting—disappearing within seconds, making it impossible for traders to take advantage of it.

## Understanding High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

High-frequency trading is a type of algorithmic trading. Traders make decisions by analyzing important data and complete transactions within seconds. HFT can facilitate a large volume of trades in a short time while tracking market dynamics and identifying arbitrage opportunities.

Key characteristics of high-frequency trading include:

- High-speed trading execution
- Large volume of transactions
- Short-term investment horizon

Given the complexity involved in HFT, it's not surprising that banks, other financial institutions, and institutional investors commonly use this strategy.

HFT gained popularity when exchanges began offering incentives to companies for increasing market liquidity. For example, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has a group of liquidity providers called Supplemental Liquidity Providers (SLPs), designed to add competition and liquidity to existing quotes.[1]

SLPs were introduced after Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in 2008 when liquidity became a primary concern for investors. To incentivize companies, NYSE pays fees or rebates to companies that provide liquidity. Millions of daily transactions allow companies to generate substantial profits.[2]

**Important Note:** Some well-known HFT firms include Tower Research Capital, Citadel LLC, and Virtu Financial.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of High-Frequency Trading

The main benefits of high-frequency trading are the speed and convenience of trade execution. Banks and other traders can execute large volumes of trades in a short time period (typically within seconds).

HFT improves market liquidity and eliminates previously small bid-ask spreads. This outcome was tested through the implementation of fees on HFT, which led to wider bid-ask spreads. A study evaluating changes in bid-ask spreads after the Canadian government introduced fees on HFT found that overall market spreads increased by 13%, while retail spreads increased by 9%.[3]

HFT has sparked controversy and faced severe criticism. It has replaced many broker-dealers, using mathematical models and algorithms for decision-making, eliminating the possibility of human decision-making and interaction.

Decisions are made within milliseconds, which can lead to massive market fluctuations. For example, on May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) experienced its largest intraday point drop at the time, falling 1,000 points and sliding 10% within just 20 minutes, before recovering. Government investigations attributed the crash to large orders triggering the sell-off.[4]

Another criticism of HFT is that it allows large companies to profit at the expense of smaller ones. The so-called phantom liquidity is also criticized: liquidity provided by HFT is available for an instant and disappears the next second, making it impossible for traders to truly utilize this liquidity.

#### Advantages

- Multiple trades can be executed simultaneously
- Simple and fast process
- Improves market liquidity
- Eliminates small bid-ask spreads

#### Disadvantages

- Eliminates human decision-making and interaction
- Rapid trading may lead to significant market volatility  
- Traders cannot take advantage of liquidity

## How Does High-Frequency Trading Work?

High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is a form of automated trading. It uses algorithms to identify trading opportunities. HFT is commonly employed by banks, financial institutions, and institutional investors, enabling these entities to execute large volumes of trades in short time periods. Since all trades are automated, trading becomes effortless. HFT provides liquidity to markets, but it can also lead to significant market volatility and eliminates the human decision-making element.

## Is High-Frequency Trading Used in Cryptocurrency Markets?

Yes, high-frequency trading exists in cryptocurrency markets. It operates in the same way as HFT in other markets. Using algorithms, it analyzes crypto data and executes a large number of trades in a short period (typically within seconds).

## How Fast is High-Frequency Trading?

High-frequency trading is extremely fast. It can achieve speeds of 10 milliseconds. In some cases, the time to execute large volumes of trades can be even shorter.[5]

## Summary

Technological advances have helped many areas of the financial industry develop, including the trading sector. Computers and algorithms have made it easier to identify opportunities and accelerate trading. High-frequency trading enables major trading entities to execute large orders very rapidly.

Although HFT (and other types of algorithmic trading) has simplified processes, it also has its drawbacks—particularly the risk of causing significant market volatility, such as the sharp intraday decline experienced by the Dow Jones in 2010.
