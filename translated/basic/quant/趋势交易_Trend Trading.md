## What is Trend Trading?

Trend trading is a trading style that aims to capture profits by analyzing an asset's momentum in a specific direction. When price moves in an overall direction, such as upward or downward, this is called a trend.

Trend traders enter long positions when a security is in an uptrend. An uptrend is characterized by higher swing lows and higher swing highs. Similarly, when an asset is in a downtrend, trend traders may choose to enter short positions. A downtrend is characterized by lower swing lows and lower swing highs.

### Key Points

- Trend trading aims to capitalize on uptrends, where prices tend to make new highs, or downtrends, where prices tend to make new lows.
- An uptrend is a series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows. A downtrend is a series of lower swing highs and lower swing lows.
- In addition to observing swing highs and lows, trend traders use other tools such as trendlines, moving averages, and technical indicators to help identify trend direction and potentially generate trading signals.

## Understanding Trend Trading

Trend trading strategies assume that securities will continue to move in the direction of the current trend. These strategies typically include take-profit or stop-loss provisions to lock in profits or avoid significant losses when trends reverse. Trend trading is suitable for short-term, medium-term, and long-term traders.

Traders use price action and other technical tools to determine trend direction and when changes might occur.

Price action traders focus on price movements on charts. For an uptrend, they want to see prices breaking above recent highs, and when prices pull back, they should stay above previous swing lows. This indicates that despite price fluctuations, the overall trajectory is upward.

The same concept applies to downtrends, where traders observe whether prices continue to make lower lows and lower highs. When this pattern stops occurring, the downtrend becomes questionable, and trend traders lose interest in maintaining short positions.

## Trend Trading Strategies

Trend trading encompasses various strategies, each utilizing multiple indicators and price action methods. All strategies should employ stop-losses for risk management. In uptrends, stop-losses are placed below swing lows that occurred before entry or below other support levels. In downtrends and short positions, stop-losses are typically placed above previous swing highs or above other resistance levels.

Traders often use combinations of these strategies when seeking trend trading opportunities. A trader might look for signals of resistance breakouts indicating potential upward movement, but only enter trades when the price is above a specific moving average.

These strategies involve entering long positions when short-term moving averages cross above long-term moving averages, or entering short positions when short-term moving averages cross below long-term moving averages. Alternatively, some traders might wait for price to break above moving averages for long signals, or break below moving averages for short signals.

Typically, moving average strategies are combined with other forms of technical analysis to filter signals. This might include observing price action to confirm trends, as moving averages provide poor signals when there is no trend; prices simply oscillate around the moving average.

Moving averages are also used for analysis. When price is above the moving average, this helps indicate a possible uptrend. When price is below the moving average, this helps indicate a possible downtrend.

There are numerous momentum indicators and strategies. For trend trading, one example might be looking for an uptrend and then using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for entry and exit signals.

For instance, a trader might wait for the RSI to fall below 30 and then rise again. This could signal a long entry, provided the overall uptrend remains valid. The indicator shows a price pullback that is now turning up again, consistent with the overall uptrend.

Traders might choose to exit when the RSI exceeds 70 or 80 and then falls back to a selected level.

Trendlines are lines drawn along the swing lows in an uptrend or swing highs in a downtrend. They show areas where price might pull back to in the future.

Some traders buy when price pulls back and bounces from an uptrend line in an uptrend, which is a buy-the-dip strategy. Similarly, some traders choose to short when price rallies and falls from a downtrend line in a downtrend.

Trend traders also watch for chart patterns such as flags or triangles that suggest potential trend continuation. For example, if price forms a flag or triangle after a strong upward move, trend traders will watch for price to break out of the pattern, signaling continuation of the uptrend.

## Trend Trading Chart Examples

The following chart of Alibaba Group demonstrates how to analyze trends and shows examples of potential trades using chart patterns and trends.

The price begins in a downtrend, then breaks above the descending trendline and moves above the moving average. However, this doesn't necessarily indicate that the trend has turned bullish. Trend traders typically wait for prices to create higher swing highs and higher swing lows before considering an uptrend.

The price continues to rise, confirming the new uptrend. It then pulls back and begins rising again, forming the first chart pattern. The price breaks through this pattern, signaling a potential long position.

The uptrend continues strongly, forming two additional chart patterns along the way. Both patterns provide opportunities to enter long positions or add to existing positions (known as scaling in).

The price continues to rise but then begins showing warning signals. The price falls below the moving average for the first time and creates a lower swing low, breaking through the short-term uptrend line.

Subsequently, the price makes a new high but falls below the moving average again. This behavior is not characteristic of a strong uptrend, and trend traders typically avoid going long in such situations. They would also look to close any remaining long positions.

The chart shows the price continuing to oscillate around the moving average, lacking a clear trend direction. Finally, the price slips into a downtrend. Trend traders would exit long positions, avoid new long positions, and potentially look for opportunities to enter short positions.
