## What is Gamma Neutral?

A gamma-neutral options position refers to an options position that has been immunized against large fluctuations in the underlying security. Achieving a gamma-neutral position is a method of managing options trading risk by creating a portfolio where the rate of change in delta remains close to zero when the underlying security moves up or down. This is known as gamma hedging. Therefore, a gamma-neutral portfolio has a hedging effect against second-order time-price sensitivity.

Gamma is one of the "options Greeks," along with Delta, Rho, Theta, and Vega. These Greeks are used to evaluate different types of risks in options portfolios. [1]

### Key Points

- A gamma-neutral portfolio is an options position whose delta remains unchanged even with significant movements in the underlying security.
- Gamma neutrality is achieved by adding additional options contracts to the portfolio, typically in contrast to current positions, a process known as gamma hedging.
- Delta-gamma hedging is commonly used to lock in profits by creating a position that is both delta-neutral and gamma-neutral.

## Understanding Gamma Neutrality

The directional risk of an options portfolio can be managed through delta hedging, creating a delta-neutral or directionally ambiguous portfolio. The issue is that as the underlying security's price changes, the option's delta itself also changes, meaning that delta-neutral positions can gain or lose delta, becoming directional speculations, especially during significant movements in the underlying security. Gamma hedging attempts to neutralize these changes in delta.

A gamma-neutral portfolio can be created by holding positions with offsetting gamma values. This helps reduce volatility caused by changes in market prices and conditions. However, gamma-neutral portfolios still face risks. For example, if the assumptions used to construct the portfolio prove incorrect, positions that should be neutral may actually become significantly risky. Additionally, positions need to be rebalanced as prices change and time passes.

Gamma-neutral options strategies can be used to establish new security positions or adjust existing ones. The goal is to use a set of options to maintain the total gamma value as close to zero as possible. A value close to zero means that delta values should not change when the underlying security price fluctuates.

It's important to note that if the goal is to achieve a lasting delta-neutral strategy, delta-gamma hedging is typically employed. However, traders might also want to maintain a specific delta position, where their delta may be positive (or negative) while remaining gamma-neutral.

Locking in profits is a common use for gamma-neutral positions. If high volatility is expected and an options trading position has currently generated good profits, rather than locking in profits by selling the position and foregoing further gains, using delta-neutral or gamma-neutral hedging can effectively lock in these profits.

## Gamma Neutral and Delta Neutral

A simple delta hedge can be created by buying call options while simultaneously selling a certain amount of the underlying stock. If the stock price remains unchanged but volatility increases, traders may profit unless time decay erodes these profits. Traders can add a short call option with a different strike price to the strategy to offset time value decay and protect against large delta fluctuations. Adding the second call option to the position is gamma hedging.

As the underlying stock price rises and falls, investors who wish to maintain a neutral position can buy or sell stock. This may increase the volatility and costs of trading. Delta and gamma hedging don't necessarily need to be completely neutral, and traders can adjust the degree of positive or negative gamma they take on over time.
