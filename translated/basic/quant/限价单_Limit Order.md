## What is a Limit Order?

In financial markets, a limit order is an instruction to buy or sell stocks or other securities at a specified price or better. This specification allows traders to have better control over their trading prices. Limit orders can be placed on both buy and sell orders:

- Buy limit orders are executed only at the limit price or lower.
- Sell limit orders are executed only at the limit price or higher.

While the price is guaranteed, the execution of the order is not. Limit orders will only be executed when the price meets the order conditions.

In contrast to limit orders, market orders require trades to be executed as quickly as possible at the current market price, without setting any price restrictions.

### Key Points

- Limit orders ensure trades are executed at a specific price level or better.
- However, limit orders do not guarantee execution.
- Limit orders control execution price but may lead to missed opportunities in rapidly changing market conditions.
- Limit orders can be used in combination with stop orders to prevent significant downside losses.
- Limit orders typically remain valid for a specific number of days (e.g., 30 days) until the order is filled or canceled by the trader.

## How Limit Orders Work

A limit order is used to buy or sell securities at a pre-set price. For example, if a trader wants to buy stock in Company XYZ but sets a limit price of $14.50, they will only purchase the stock at $14.50 or lower. If a trader places a sell limit order for XYZ stock at $14.50, they won't sell any shares until the price reaches $14.50 or higher.

By using a buy limit order, investors can guarantee they will pay the limit price or better, but there is no guarantee that the order will be executed. Limit orders give traders more control over execution prices during volatile market conditions, especially when they don't want to use market orders.

Limit orders are particularly useful when stock prices are rising or falling rapidly, and traders are concerned that using market orders could result in unfavorable executions. Additionally, limit orders can set specific buy or sell prices when traders aren't constantly monitoring a stock. Limit orders can also be set with expiration dates.

## Limit Order Example

A portfolio manager wants to buy Tesla (TSLA) stock but believes the current valuation of around $750 is too high and wants to buy when the stock price falls to a specific level. The manager instructs the trader to buy 10,000 shares of Tesla if the price drops below $650, with the order being "Good Till Canceled" (GTC). The trader then places an order with a limit price of $650. If the stock price falls below this limit, the trader can begin purchasing the stock. This order will remain active until either the stock reaches the manager's limit price or the manager cancels the order.

Additionally, the manager wants to sell Amazon (AMZN) stock but believes the current price of around $2,300 is too low. They instruct the trader to sell 5,000 shares if the price rises above $2,750, with this order also being "Good Till Canceled". The trader will then place a sell order for 5,000 shares with a limit price of $2,750.

**Note:** If a limit order is set illogically (for example, a buy limit price above the market price), the brokerage firm may not allow the limit order. Furthermore, some brokerages may offer this service to investors without charging fees.

## Differences Between Limit Orders and Market Orders

When investors place orders to buy or sell stocks, there are two main price execution options: placing orders at "market price" or at "limit price." Market orders are trades intended to execute as quickly as possible at the current market price. In contrast, limit orders set the maximum or minimum price at which you are willing to buy or sell. Generally, brokers charge higher fees for executing more complex limit orders.

Buying stocks can be compared to purchasing a car. When buying a car, you can either pay the dealer's asking price to get the vehicle immediately, or you can negotiate with the dealer and refuse to complete the transaction if they don't meet your price. The stock market operates on a similar mechanism.

Market orders focus on order execution; the security's price is secondary, and the speed of completing the transaction is more important. Limit orders, however, primarily focus on price; if the security's value currently exceeds the parameters set in the limit order, the trade will not occur.

## What is a Limit Order?

A limit order is an instruction given to a broker to buy or sell a security at a specified price or better. It is a way for traders to execute trades at their desired price without having to continuously monitor the market. Additionally, limit orders serve as a risk hedging method, minimizing potential losses by capturing sale prices at specific price levels.

## How Do Limit Orders Work?

A limit order is submitted to a broker and includes the security name, quantity, price, and whether you are buying or selling. The order is only triggered when the market price reaches the specified target price. Even then, execution of limit orders is not guaranteed in highly volatile markets, especially for illiquid and highly volatile securities.

## What's the difference between limit orders and stop-limit orders?

A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price. A stop-limit order adds an additional requirement on top of this, requiring a specific price different from the selling price to be reached. For example, a limit order to sell a security at $15 will typically execute when the market price reaches $15. However, a stop-limit order can be set to sell the security only when the stock price falls from $20 to $16.

## How long is a limit order valid for?

The validity period of a limit order depends on your specifications and your broker's policies. Many brokers set limit orders as "day orders" by default; any unfilled orders will be canceled without execution at market close. Other brokers may offer settings for specific numbers of days, typically in 30-day intervals (such as 30, 60, or 90 days). Finally, some brokers offer "Good Till Cancelled" (GTC) limit orders, which remain valid until either filled or actively canceled by the trader.

## Why Didn't My Limit Order Execute?

There are several reasons why a limit order may not execute. First, your limit order will only trigger when the market price reaches your specified buy or sell price. If the security is trading above your buy limit price or below your sell limit price, it typically won't execute until the security's price moves to your specified level.

Limit orders can only execute when there is liquidity in the security. If there aren't enough shares trading at your specified price, your order may not fill. This is most common with low-volume securities. Due to volatility, stocks on their IPO day may face execution difficulties because of dramatic price fluctuations.
