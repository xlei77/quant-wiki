Arbitrageurs are investors who attempt to profit from market inefficiencies. Many arbitrageurs take advantage of price inconsistencies of the same asset across different markets by simultaneously buying the asset at a lower price and selling it at a higher price in different markets. Risk arbitrageurs, on the other hand, attempt to profit from price differentials during mergers and acquisitions before the deal closes.

### Key Points

- Arbitrageurs exploit market inefficiencies. They are considered necessary actors in ensuring these inefficiencies are minimized.
- Arbitrageurs are typically experienced investors who must pay attention to detail and be able to bear risks.
- The most common way arbitrageurs profit is by exploiting price differences between assets listed on multiple exchanges.
- In these situations, arbitrageurs may buy the asset on one exchange and short sell it on a second exchange where the price is higher.
- Merger arbitrageurs attempt to profit from the spread between the quoted price of stocks involved in acquisition deals and the price before the deal closes.

## Work Content of Arbitrageurs

This financial field often faces misconceptions. For example, many people might know that arbitrageurs seek price differences between stocks by buying undervalued stocks on one exchange while simultaneously short-selling the same amount of overvalued stocks on another exchange. This leads people to believe they can capture so-called "risk-free" profits because prices between the two exchanges will converge. However, this financial activity is full of risks.

Therefore, it's worth emphasizing that: although true for certain trading situations, arbitrageurs' trades are far from risk-free. Many arbitrageurs focus on merger arbitrage, which is filled with various risks.

Another fundamental misconception relates to historically illegal behavior where arbitrageurs, if involved, could face legal risks—not just hefty fines but potentially imprisonment. Historically, in risk or merger arbitrage, arbitrageurs would often obtain insider information to get ahead of merger announcements. They might have connections with law firms, investment banks, and accounting firms, or call major companies likely to expand. The goal was to obtain crucial information (often for a fee) that would allow arbitrageurs to trade before any public announcement.

In the 1980s, several insider trading cases, including that of arbitrageur Ivan Boesky, led to the passage of the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988, which increased penalties and required the SEC to strengthen enforcement against insider trading. In 2000, the SEC introduced Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure), further restricting information available to arbitrageurs. Any material information must be broadly disclosed publicly rather than shared privately with select individuals.

This brings us to another aspect of arbitrageurs' work: while it's commonly believed that arbitrageurs' work ends after a merger announcement (and profit-taking after related stocks rise), in reality, modern arbitrageurs' work often begins at this point.

So what do arbitrageurs actually do? Let's first look at merger arbitrage, which has become the basis for several Hollywood movie plots over the years.

Also known as risk arbitrage, merger arbitrage involves capitalizing on the price difference between a target company's stock price and the proposed acquisition price. When a merger is announced, the target company's stock typically trades below the offer price, reflecting uncertainties or risk factors associated with the deal. Arbitrageurs often step in at this point, believing the merger is likely to be approved and the target company's stock will eventually converge with the offer price. They exploit this price gap by purchasing the target company's stock at the lower market price and then selling at the higher offer price when the deal closes.

Once a merger or acquisition is announced, arbitrageurs begin tracking the deal's details. Their role falls somewhere between financial analyst and investigative journalist—if they only reported to one public company. Arbitrageurs are determining whether the deal will proceed smoothly.

Their first steps typically include obtaining annual and quarterly reports and 10-K filings from relevant companies to assess their financial conditions. The better the companies' financial health, the more likely the deal is to complete. Arbitrageurs also gather research about both companies and their industries from brokerage firms. Online databases and services have greatly simplified this process. They also want to understand the industry and the logic behind the deal. A strategically sensible merger is not only a valuable portfolio addition but also more likely to complete successfully.

The AT&T/Time Warner (announced 2016; closed 2018) and Disney/Fox (announced 2017; closed 2019) mergers presented significant arbitrage opportunities. Both mergers faced legal challenges and regulatory scrutiny over media concentration concerns. Delays meant arbitrageurs tracked progress at every step—court cases here, regulatory rulings there—while calculating the probability of these deals succeeding.

Arbitrageurs are typically financial generalists and must learn quickly, as they might focus on a deal between two manufacturing companies one day and shift to natural gas companies with complex proven reserves and pipelines near the Black Sea the next. At each turn, arbitrageurs are trying to assess their companies' potential returns, risks, and the likelihood of deal completion. Only after this can arbitrageurs determine which stocks to buy and what hedging strategies to employ if the deal fails.

Between deal announcement and completion, the following issues might arise:

- Financing disappears: Funds needed for the deal might vanish. For instance, the companies' financial situations might change, or market interest rates might rise. In these cases, the deal cannot proceed even if all parties are willing.
- Antitrust regulatory intervention: Agencies monitoring fair competition might file lawsuits to block deals. For example, in early 2024, a federal court blocked JetBlue Airways' (JBLU) planned $3.8 billion acquisition of budget airline Spirit Airlines (SAVE) based on a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice, citing concerns about consumer price increases.
- Economic climate changes: Broad economic environment changes might make mergers less viable. Market condition fluctuations, consumer demand changes, or broader economic recessions might diminish merger benefits. For example, in February 2008, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) planned to acquire Yahoo! for $44.6 billion. As the financial crisis worsened, Microsoft deemed Yahoo's price unrealistic in the current economic climate and withdrew from the deal three months later.
- Discovery of fraud or accounting issues: If fraud or material misrepresentations emerge during deal completion, it can derail the transaction.
- Emergence of competitors: Third parties might enter the market with more competitive offers, disrupting the original deal process.

Monitoring these risks makes merger arbitrage an ongoing process. Arbitrageurs might track case developments in Delaware courts. Meanwhile, they might closely watch global economic indicators and regulatory changes that could affect deal success. Arbitrageurs also maintain constant contact with industry experts, legal advisors, and other arbitrageurs to gather information about any developments, market trends, and changes in investor sentiment, adjusting strategies when necessary.

## Cross-Market Price Arbitrage

Here are some ways arbitrageurs attempt to profit from price differences across different markets:

- Global Equity Arbitrage: This involves exploiting price differences of the same stock listed on multiple stock exchanges. The same stock may trade at slightly different prices in different markets due to exchange rate fluctuations, regional market sentiment differences, or varying liquidity levels. Arbitrageurs look for these price differences and execute synchronized buy and sell orders to profit.

**Important Note:** When an asset is listed in multiple markets, its price may not always be identical.

- Cryptocurrency Arbitrage: Similar arbitrage opportunities arise from price differences between cryptocurrency exchanges. Traders capitalize on these price gaps to profit from crypto market volatility.
- Index Arbitrage: For stock index futures and options, arbitrageurs conduct index arbitrage to exploit price differences between the underlying index and its futures or options contracts. This includes S&P 500 index arbitrage and other equity index arbitrage strategies.
- Fixed Income Arbitrage: Arbitrage opportunities can also emerge in fixed income markets, where traders attempt to profit from yield differentials, interest rate disparities, or credit risk differences between different bonds and other debt securities.
- Convertible Bond Arbitrage: Arbitrage opportunities may exist between a company's stock and its bonds. In convertible bond arbitrage, arbitrageurs attempt to profit from differences between the conversion price of convertible bonds and the company's stock price.
- Cross-Border Arbitrage: In foreign exchange markets, traders may seek opportunities to profit from currency pair rate differences between different markets or forex brokers.

## Real-World Examples of Arbitrageurs

Let's look at an example of how arbitrageurs work. Suppose Company X's stock trades at $20 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), while simultaneously trading at $20.05 on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). A trader can buy the stock on the NYSE and immediately sell the same stock on the LSE, earning a profit of 5 cents per share, minus any transaction costs. Traders exploit this arbitrage opportunity until either NYSE specialists run out of Company X's inventory, or the NYSE or LSE adjusts prices to eliminate this opportunity.

The rise of cryptocurrencies has provided arbitrageurs with another opportunity. As Bitcoin prices climbed, arbitrage opportunities emerged between price differences across multiple global exchanges.

For example, Bitcoin trades at a premium on South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges compared to U.S. trading, a price difference known as the "Kimchi premium," primarily due to high demand for cryptocurrencies in these regions. Crypto traders profit from the price gap between these two locations in real-time.

## Impact of Arbitrage

Arbitrageurs play an important role in capital market operations because they make prices more accurate than they would be without intervention by exploiting price inefficiencies. When arbitrageurs buy assets in cheaper markets and sell the same assets in more expensive markets, their actions typically drive prices in both markets to gradually converge. This leads to essentially equal prices across all markets.

In short, arbitrageurs help resolve pricing inefficiencies and inject liquidity into markets.

## What Technologies Do Arbitrageurs Use?

Arbitrageurs typically use trading software specifically designed for algorithmic trading. This software can process real-time market data, analyze information, and execute trades rapidly after processing. Additionally, many arbitrageurs use customized systems tailored to their specific trading strategies. These systems are usually equipped with powerful processors and high-speed internet connections to minimize trade execution time. Cloud computing and data analytics are crucial in this process, as traders often need to store, process, and analyze large datasets while searching for arbitrage opportunities across global markets.

## How Do Arbitrageurs Reduce Risk?

Arbitrageurs face the risk that expected asset price convergence may not materialize or may take longer than anticipated, which can lead to losses. Additionally, delays or failures in trade execution can erode profit margins. Furthermore, regarding liquidity risk, arbitrageurs face the risk of being unable to quickly buy or sell assets at expected prices, which is related to thin market trading volumes. To mitigate these risks, arbitrageurs typically diversify their investments across different arbitrage opportunities to avoid significant losses in any single area. They also employ sophisticated risk management tools and techniques, including real-time monitoring systems and stop-loss orders, to limit potential losses. Many arbitrageurs also engage in hedging strategies to offset potential losses from market volatility.

## What is the Role of High-Frequency Trading (HFT) in Arbitrage?

High-frequency trading plays a crucial role in modern arbitrage strategies. High-frequency trading involves executing large volumes of orders using sophisticated algorithms at extremely high speeds. For arbitrage purposes, HFT allows traders to capitalize on brief price discrepancies that may exist between different exchanges or securities for just fractions of a second. These algorithms can analyze market conditions, execute orders, and close positions in an instant, often before the market has a chance to correct these inefficiencies.

## Conclusion

Arbitrageurs search for inefficiencies in the market and profit from them. These inefficiencies typically relate to different quotes for the same asset across different exchanges. However, this can also involve deep research into market movements, such as mergers and acquisitions, to profit from price discrepancies in these transactions.

Arbitrageurs typically work for large financial firms with substantial resources, and their work helps improve liquidity and makes market prices more equitable.
