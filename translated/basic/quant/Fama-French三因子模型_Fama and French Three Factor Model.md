## Introduction to the Fama-French Three-Factor Model

The Fama-French Three-Factor Model (abbreviated as Fama-French Model) is an asset pricing model developed in 1992. The model expands upon the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) by adding size risk and value risk factors to the market risk factor. The model takes into account the phenomenon that value stocks and small-cap stocks frequently outperform the market. By introducing these two additional factors, the model adjusts for this outperformance, which is considered to make it a more effective tool for evaluating manager performance.

### Key Points

- The Fama-French Three-Factor Model is an asset pricing model that adds size risk and value risk factors to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
- The model was developed in the 1990s by Nobel laureate Eugene Fama and his colleague Kenneth French.
- The model is essentially the result of an econometric regression analysis of historical stock prices.

## Understanding the Fama-French Three-Factor Model

Nobel laureate Eugene Fama and researcher Kenneth French, former professors at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, aimed to measure market returns more accurately and discovered through research that value stocks outperform growth stocks.[1] Similarly, small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks. As an evaluation tool, portfolios containing large amounts of small-cap or value stocks typically perform below CAPM results, as the three-factor model adjusts downward for the observed excess performance of small-cap and value stocks.

The Fama-French model's three factors include company size, book-to-market ratio, and market excess return. In other words, the model uses Small Minus Big (SMB), High Minus Low book-to-market ratio (HML), and portfolio returns minus the risk-free rate. SMB considers smaller market capitalization public companies, which typically generate higher returns, while HML analyzes high book-to-market value stocks, which tend to achieve higher returns compared to the market.[2]

Debate continues between market efficiency and inefficiency regarding the reasons for excess performance. Proponents of market efficiency argue that excess performance can typically be explained by the additional risks faced by value stocks and small-cap stocks due to their higher cost of capital and greater business risks. Those supporting market inefficiency contend that market participants make errors in pricing these companies' values, thus providing excess returns over the long term. Investors who believe in the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) evidence are more likely to agree with the market efficiency perspective.

The formula is:

$$ \begin{aligned} &R_{it} - R_{ft} = \alpha_{it} + \beta_1 ( R_{Mt} - R_{ft} ) + \beta_2SMB_t + \beta_3HML_t + \epsilon_{it} \\ &\textbf{其中：} \\ &R_{it} = \text{某股票或投资组合 } i \text{ 在时间 } t \text{ 的总回报} \\ &R_{ft} = \text{时间 } t \text{ 的无风险回报率} \\ &R_{Mt} = \text{时间 } t \text{ 的市场组合总回报} \\ &R_{it} - R_{ft} = \text{预期超额回报} \\ &R_{Mt} - R_{ft} = \text{市场组合（指数）的超额回报} \\ &SMB_t = \text{规模溢价（小盘减大盘）} \\ &HML_t = \text{价值溢价（高账面市值比减低账面市值比）} \\ &\beta_{1,2,3} = \text{因子系数} \\ \end{aligned} $$

Fama and French emphasize that investors must be able to withstand additional volatility and cyclical underperformance that may occur in the short term. Investors with 15-year or longer investment horizons will be compensated for short-term losses. Fama and French tested their model by studying thousands of random stock portfolios and found that when combining size and value factors with the beta factor, they could explain up to 95% of the returns of diversified stock portfolios.

Given that the model can explain up to 95% of portfolio returns, investors can construct a portfolio that earns average expected returns according to the relative risks taken in their portfolio. The main factors driving expected returns include market sensitivity, size sensitivity, and value stock sensitivity, measured through the book-to-market ratio. Any additional average expected returns may be attributed to unpriced or non-systematic risks.

## Fama and French's Five-Factor Model

In recent years, researchers have expanded the three-factor model to include additional factors. These factors include "momentum," "quality," "low volatility," and others. In 2014, Fama and French modified their model to include five factors. Building upon the original three factors, the new model added a concept that companies with higher future earnings tend to have higher returns in the stock market, a factor known as profitability.

The fifth factor, called "investment," relates to the concept of internal investment and returns, suggesting that companies that invest their profits in major growth projects may face losses in the stock market.[3]

## The Significance of the Fama-French Three-Factor Model for Investors

The Fama-French three-factor model emphasizes that investors must be able to tolerate additional volatility and potential cyclical underperformance in the short term. Investors with a 15-year or longer investment horizon will profit from short-term losses. Given that the model can explain up to 95% of returns for diversified stock portfolios, investors can tailor their portfolios according to their relative risk tolerance to achieve average expected returns.

The main factors driving expected returns include market sensitivity, size sensitivity, and value stock sensitivity, which are measured through the book-to-market ratio. Any additional average expected returns may be attributed to unpriced or non-systematic risks.

## What are the three factors in the model?

The Fama-French model has three factors: company size, book-to-market ratio, and market excess return. In other words, the model uses Small Minus Big (SMB), High Minus Low book-to-market ratio (HML), and portfolio returns minus the risk-free rate. SMB considers listed companies with smaller market capitalization, which typically generate higher returns, while HML analyzes value stocks with high book-to-market ratios, which tend to outperform the market.

## What is the Fama-French Five-Factor Model?

In 2014, Fama and French modified their model, expanding it to five factors. In addition to the original three factors, the new model introduced a concept that companies reporting higher future earnings typically have higher returns in the stock market, known as the profitability factor. The fifth factor, called "investment," relates to internal investment and return patterns, indicating that companies using profits for major growth projects might face losses in the stock market.
