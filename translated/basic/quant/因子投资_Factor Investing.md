## What is Factor Investing?

Factor investing is an investment strategy that selects securities based on specific attributes that are associated with higher returns. There are two main types of factors that drive returns in stocks, bonds, and other assets: macroeconomic factors and style factors. The former captures broad risks across asset classes, while the latter aims to explain returns and risks within the same asset class.

Common macroeconomic factors include: inflation rate, GDP growth rate, and unemployment rate. Microeconomic factors include: company credit status, stock liquidity, and stock price volatility. Style factors involve growth versus value stocks, market capitalization, and industry sectors.

### Key Points

- Factor investing utilizes multiple factors, including macroeconomic factors, fundamental factors, and statistical factors, to analyze and explain asset prices and construct investment strategies.
- Factors identified by investors include: growth and value, market capitalization, credit ratings, and stock price volatility, among others.
- Smart beta is a common application of factor investing strategies.

## Deep Understanding of Factor Investing

From a theoretical perspective, factor investing aims to enhance portfolio diversification, generate returns that exceed the market, and manage risk. Portfolio diversification has long been popular, but if the selected securities fluctuate in sync with the overall market, the benefits of diversification can be negated. For example, when certain market conditions arise, both stocks and bonds that investors might choose could decline in value simultaneously. Fortunately, factor investing can offset potential risks by targeting broad, persistent, and long-recognized return drivers.

Considering traditional portfolio allocation, such as 60% stocks and 40% bonds, is relatively easy to implement, while factor investing appears more complex due to the numerous types of factors available. For factor investing beginners, it's advisable to focus on simpler elements such as style (growth versus value), size (large-cap versus small-cap), and risk (beta), rather than complex attributes. These attributes are easily obtainable for most securities and are detailed on popular stock research websites.

## Fundamentals of Factor Investing

Value factors aim to capture excess returns from stocks that are priced low relative to their fundamental value. This is typically tracked through indicators such as price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio, dividends, and free cash flow.[1]

Historically, portfolios of small-cap stocks have typically generated higher returns than portfolios containing only large-cap stocks. Investors can capture this size effect by observing stocks' market capitalization.[2]

Stocks that have performed well in the past tend to demonstrate strong returns in the future as well. Momentum strategies are based on relative returns over a time horizon of three months to one year.[3]

Quality factors are primarily defined through low leverage, stable earnings, and consistent asset growth. Investors can identify quality stocks using common financial metrics such as return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio, and earnings volatility.[4]

Empirical studies show that low-volatility stocks typically outperform high-volatility assets on a risk-adjusted basis.[5] Standard deviation measurements over one to three years are a common method for capturing beta.

## Example: Fama-French Three-Factor Model

A widely used multi-factor model is the Fama-French three-factor model, which is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The model was developed by economists Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, using three factors: company size, book-to-market ratio, and market excess returns. In the model's terminology, the three factors are SMB (Small Minus Big), HML (High Minus Low), and the portfolio return minus the risk-free rate. SMB considers small-cap listed companies, which generate higher returns, while HML focuses on value stocks with high book-to-market ratios, which typically generate higher returns compared to the market.
