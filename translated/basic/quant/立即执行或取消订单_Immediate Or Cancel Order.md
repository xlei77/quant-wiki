## What is an IOC Order?

Immediate-Or-Cancel (IOC) order is a type of buy or sell order for securities that executes immediately either partially or fully, and then cancels any unfilled portion. IOC orders are one of several "duration" or time-in-force orders that investors can use to specify how long an order remains active in the market and under what conditions it should be canceled.

Other common duration order types include Fill-Or-Kill (FOK), All-Or-None (AON), and Good-Till-Canceled (GTC). Most online trading platforms allow IOC orders to be placed manually or incorporated into automated trading strategies.

### Key Points

- Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC) orders attempt to execute immediately and cancel any unfilled portion.
- IOC orders allow partial fills and can be specified as either limit or market orders.
- IOC is a duration order type, along with Fill-or-Kill (FOK), All-or-None (AON), and Good-til-Canceled (GTC).

## How IOC Works

Investors can submit "limit" or "market" Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC) orders based on their specific execution needs. IOC limit orders are entered at a specific price, while IOC market orders are submitted without a price and trade at the best bid for buying and best offer for selling.

IOC orders differ from other duration orders in that they only require partial execution, whereas FOK and AON orders must be fully executed or cancelled. GTC orders remain active until executed in the market or cancelled by the client, although most brokers cancel them between 30 to 90 days.

## When to Use IOC Orders

Investors typically use IOC orders when submitting large orders to avoid executing at different prices. IOC orders automatically cancel any portion that doesn't execute immediately. For example, if a trader places an IOC order to buy 5,000 shares of International Business Machines (IBM), any portion of the 5,000 shares that cannot be purchased immediately will be automatically canceled. Those who trade multiple stocks within a day may use IOC orders to reduce the risk of forgetting to cancel orders at market close.

**Tip:** IOC orders help investors limit risk, speed up execution, and improve pricing by providing greater flexibility.

## Example

Suppose an investor places an IOC market order to buy 1,000 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The order book shows 2,000 shares bid at $170.95 and 500 shares offered at $171.00. The order will immediately execute 500 shares at the offer price ($171.00), and the unfilled portion of 500 shares will be canceled.

Consider another scenario where an investor places an IOC limit order at market open to buy 1,000 shares of Apple stock at $169.00, while the stock is offered at $170.00. Later in the afternoon, as the S&P 500 declines slightly, a seller quotes 700 shares of AAPL at $169.00. However, since the IOC order was not filled earlier in the day, it would have already been canceled.

## Benefits of Using IOC

IOC limit orders can prevent unfavorable executions in markets with rapid fluctuations or insufficient liquidity. On the other hand, IOC market orders ensure full or partial execution in stocks with strong demand.

## How does IOC affect market orders or limit orders?

A market order is an order to buy or sell stocks at the best available price and will be executed immediately. A limit order is an order to buy or sell stocks at a specific price or better. Both market orders and limit orders may contain time restrictions and other trading instructions, such as IOC.[1]

## What does validity period mean for market traders?

When placing orders, traders use validity period instructions to specify how long an order will remain active before it is either executed or expires.

## Conclusion

Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC) orders are orders to buy or sell securities that execute immediately either in full or in part, with any unfilled portion being automatically canceled, in conjunction with time-in-force instructions. IOC limit orders protect investors in rapidly fluctuating markets, while IOC market orders ensure full or partial execution in strong markets with high demand.
