## What is Long/Short Equity?

Long/short equity is an investment strategy that aims to establish long positions in stocks expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks expected to depreciate. The long/short equity strategy seeks to profit from price increases in long positions while reducing market risk, as well as profit from price declines in short positions. Although not always the case, the strategy should typically maintain profitability on a net basis.

Long/short equity is a highly liquid alternative strategy favored by hedge funds, many of which employ market-neutral strategies where the dollar amounts of long and short positions are equal.

### Key Points

- Long/short equity is an investment strategy that aims to establish long positions in undervalued stocks while simultaneously selling short overvalued stocks.
- Long/short equity seeks to enhance traditional long-only investments by capitalizing on profit opportunities between securities considered undervalued and overvalued.
- Long/short equity is commonly used by hedge funds, which often maintain a net long bias, such as a 130/30 strategy where long exposure is 130% of assets under management and short exposure is 30%.

## How Long/Short Equity Works

Long/short equity operates by capitalizing on potential profit opportunities in both upward and downward expected price movements. The strategy identifies and establishes long positions in stocks considered relatively undervalued while simultaneously taking short positions in stocks deemed overvalued.

While many hedge funds also employ long/short equity strategies with a long bias (e.g., 130/30, where long exposure is 130% and short exposure is 30%), relatively few hedge funds adopt a short bias in their long/short strategies. This is because historically, finding profitable short ideas has typically been more challenging than finding long ideas.

Long/short equity strategies can be differentiated in multiple ways—by market geography (developed economies, emerging markets, Europe, etc.), sectors (energy, technology, etc.), investment philosophy (value or growth), and so on.

An example of a long/short equity strategy with a broad mandate might be a global equity growth fund, while an example of a relatively narrow mandate might be an emerging markets healthcare fund.

## Long-Short Equity and Equity Market Neutral

The main difference between long-short equity funds and equity market neutral (EMN) funds is that the latter attempts to exploit price differentials by establishing long and short positions in stocks with similar characteristics.

EMN strategies attempt to maintain roughly equal total values in their long and short positions, which helps reduce overall risk. To maintain equivalence between long and short positions, equity market neutral funds must rebalance as market trends establish and strengthen.

Consequently, while other long-short hedge funds let profits run and even leverage up during market trends, equity market neutral funds actively trim gains and increase the size of offsetting positions. When markets inevitably reverse again, equity market neutral funds once again cut profitable positions in favor of the losing side of their portfolio.

Hedge funds employing equity market neutral strategies typically target institutional investors looking for aggressive funds that can outperform bonds without taking on higher risk and higher returns.

## Long-Short Equity Example: Pair Trading

A common variant of long-short models is "pair trading," which involves offsetting a long position in one stock against a short position in another stock within the same industry.

For example, a technology sector investor might establish a long position in Microsoft offset by a short position in Intel. If the investor purchases 1,000 shares of Microsoft at $33 per share, while Intel is trading at $22, the short side of this pair trade would involve purchasing 1,500 shares of Intel to equalize the dollar amount of the long and short positions.

The ideal scenario for this long-short strategy is for Microsoft to appreciate while Intel depreciates. If Microsoft rises to $35 and Intel falls to $21, the overall profit from the strategy would be $3,500. Even if Intel rises to $23—since factors that drive stocks up or down in a particular industry tend to be similar—the strategy would still profit by $500, albeit with a smaller gain.

To address the fact that stocks within the same industry tend to rise or fall together, long-short strategies typically prefer to use different industries for the long and short components. For example, if interest rates rise, a hedge fund might short interest-rate sensitive sectors like utilities while maintaining long positions in defensive sectors like healthcare.
