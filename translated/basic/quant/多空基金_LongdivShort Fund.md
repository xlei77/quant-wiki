## What are Long/Short Funds?

Long/short funds are mutual funds, hedge funds, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that simultaneously take both long and short investment positions. Simply put, these funds establish long positions in stocks they expect to appreciate in value while taking short positions in stocks they believe will depreciate. These funds typically employ investment techniques pioneered by hedge funds—leverage, derivatives, short positions, etc.—which were later adopted by mutual funds and ETFs. As the name suggests, most hedge funds fall into this category, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) lists 176 mutual funds and ETFs in this category.[1] Long/short funds are also known as enhanced or 130/30 funds.

### Key Points

- Long-short funds employ an investment strategy that establishes long positions in undervalued stocks while simultaneously short selling overvalued stocks.
- Long-short trading goes beyond traditional long-only investing by capitalizing on profit opportunities from securities deemed both undervalued and overvalued.
- Long-short equity strategies are commonly used by hedge funds, typically with a 130/30 position structure where 130% of assets are long exposure and 30% are short.
- Due to the extensive active management, analysis, and trading required by these funds, their expense ratios tend to be higher.

## Understanding Long-Short Funds

Long-short funds aim to enhance returns by investing in specific markets while simultaneously taking both long and short positions. Due to the need for active management, expertise, and analysis, these funds typically have higher expense ratios. As of 2024, the average expense ratio for long-short funds listed in the FINRA database is 1.98%, compared to 0.42% for all equity mutual funds in 2023.[2]

Like their long-short hedge fund counterparts, these mutual funds and ETFs employ similar strategies but with notable differences. They offer comparable portfolios, balancing higher risks with greater return potential, benchmarked against standard indices. Most long-short funds offer higher liquidity than long-short hedge funds, with no lock-up periods and relatively lower fees. However, their expense ratios remain higher than other public funds, and their liquidity is relatively lower. Additionally, many funds require high minimum investment thresholds and are among the 9% of mutual funds that impose front-end and back-end loads (commissions).[2]

Historically, mutual funds and ETFs, particularly those employing long-short strategies, have faced restrictions on leverage and risk tolerance. Beginning in the Great Depression era, these restrictions were designed to protect retail investors who might not fully understand the complexity of these financial instruments. Although certain rules have been relaxed in recent years, regulation remains strict to protect public investors from inappropriate risks.[4]

Long-short funds can be good investment choices for investors seeking targeted index exposure and some active management—provided you understand the risks involved. Long-short funds also offer hedging capabilities against market changes and other trends, allowing better managers to make adjustments.

## 130-30 Strategy

The most common long-short strategy involves taking 130% long positions and 30% short positions (130 - 30 = 100%) in asset management.[5] For example, a fund manager might rank S&P 500 stocks based on expected returns, from best to worst.

The fund management team collects extensive data and uses quantitative rules to rank stocks. Selection criteria may include total returns, risk-adjusted performance, or relative strength over a specific period—six months, one year, or other timeframes.

The manager can then invest 100% in the highest-ranked stocks and take short positions in the lowest-ranked stocks, up to 30% of the portfolio value. Proceeds from short sales are reinvested in the highest-ranked stocks, thereby gaining greater exposure to upward price movements.[5]

## Long-Short Fund Examples

Let's look at two examples to illustrate how two funds in this category allocate their assets in distinctly different ways.

AQR Long-Short Equity Fund is one of the better-performing long-term investors in the long-short equity fund space. The fund invests in companies across multiple global sectors, as shown in the figure below. You can see the percentage of long and short positions the fund holds in each sector.

As of Q1 2024, the fund has achieved annualized total returns of 23.04%, 13.32%, and 10.[6]% over the past three, five, and ten years respectively. Its annual expense ratio is 4.35%6.

The Invesco S&P 500 Downside Hedged ETF (PHDG) is an actively managed ETF designed to achieve positive returns in both bull and bear markets, regardless of stock and bond trends. This ETF contrasts sharply with QLEIX, demonstrating how long-short funds can take markedly different approaches to hedging downside risk.

While QLEIX typically takes short positions in the same sectors where it establishes long positions, PHDG allocates its assets among components of the S&P 500 Dynamic VEQTOR Index. The latter includes stocks representing the S&P 500 index, volatility hedges representing the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index, and cash. Below is its holdings chart.

Invesco states that its fund tracks the broader stock market performance while providing a hedge against implied volatility. The fund adjusts its exposure based on the S&P 500 index's equity and volatility. As of April 2024, the fund's expense ratio is 0.39%—relatively low for an actively managed fund, though it has characteristics of index funds, which typically have lower fees. Meanwhile, its three-year, five-year, and ten-year returns are 4.41%, 7.05%, and 4.69% respectively.

## What is the difference between long and short investing?

Long investing involves buying securities with the expectation of selling them at a higher price in the future. Short investing, on the other hand, involves borrowing stocks from a broker, selling them, and then buying them back at a lower price to return to the broker, with the aim of profiting from a decline in the security's value.[7]

## What other investments are similar to long-short funds?

Broadly speaking, options and other derivatives trading are typically used to hedge downside risk in stocks. However, long-short funds incorporate them for performance optimization. Market neutral funds attempt to profit from price differentials between stocks while minimizing overall market exposure. They establish long and short positions between carefully matched stocks to hedge broader market risk. There's also pairs trading, where the strategy involves taking a long position in one stock while simultaneously taking a short position in a closely correlated stock. The goal is to profit from temporary price discrepancies between them.[8]

## Why is Short Selling Riskier Than Going Long?

Short selling is considered riskier primarily because there is no limit to how high a stock's price can rise. When you establish a long position, your worst-case loss is limited to 100%. However, with short selling, there is no upper limit to potential losses.[5]

## Summary

Long-short funds don't just invest in stocks that are considered undervalued. These funds stand out because they also engage in short selling, profiting from price depreciation. The additional trading activity increases the potential for higher returns, but at a cost: long-short funds typically carry more risk, higher fees, and lower liquidity than conventional mutual funds.
