## What is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)?

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between systematic risk (i.e., the general risk of investment) and the expected return of assets (especially stocks). It is a financial model that establishes a linear relationship between required return and risk for investments.

CAPM is based on the relationship between an asset's Beta value, the risk-free rate (typically government bond rates), and the equity risk premium (the expected market return minus the risk-free rate).

CAPM was developed to measure this systematic risk. It is widely used in finance to price risky securities and generate expected returns for assets, taking into account the risk of these assets and the cost of capital.

### Key Points

- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model for calculating the expected rate of return for an asset or investment.
- CAPM achieves this by utilizing the expected returns of the market and risk-free assets, along with the correlation between the asset and the market (Beta).
- CAPM has certain limitations, such as making unrealistic assumptions and relying on a linear interpretation of risk and return.
- Despite these issues, the CAPM formula remains widely used because it is simple and convenient for comparing investment options.
- For example, CAPM is often used in conjunction with Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to understand portfolio risk and expected returns.

## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Formula

The formula for calculating the expected return of an asset given its risk is as follows:

$$ \begin{aligned} &ER_i = R_f + \beta_i ( ER_m - R_f ) \\ &\textbf{其中：} \\ &ER_i = \text{投资的预期回报} \\ &R_f = \text{无风险利率} \\ &\beta_i = \text{投资的Beta值} \\ &(ER_m - R_f) = \text{市场风险溢价} \\ \end{aligned} $$

Investors expect compensation for both risk and the time value of money. The risk-free rate in the CAPM formula accounts for the time value of money. The other components of the CAPM formula consider situations where investors take on additional risk.

The purpose of the CAPM formula is to evaluate whether a stock is fairly valued when comparing its risk and time value of money against its expected return. In other words, by understanding the individual components of CAPM, one can determine whether a stock's current price is consistent with its expected return.

**Important Note:** CAPM is designed to determine whether a stock's current price is consistent with its expected return.

## CAPM and its Beta Value

Beta measures the relationship between a security's or portfolio's volatility or systematic risk compared to the market. If a stock has more risk than the market, its Beta will be greater than 1. If a stock's Beta is less than 1, the formula assumes it will reduce the portfolio's risk.

A stock's Beta is multiplied by the market risk premium, which is the expected return above the risk-free rate in the market. The risk-free rate is then added to the product of the stock's Beta and market risk premium. This result should provide investors with the required rate of return or discount rate that they can use to calculate the value of an asset.

## CAPM Example

Suppose an investor is considering a stock currently valued at $100 per share that pays a 3% annual dividend. Assume this stock has a Beta of 1.3 with the market, meaning it is more volatile than the market portfolio (i.e., the S&P 500 index). Also assume that the risk-free rate is 3%, and the investor expects the market to rise by 8% annually.

Based on the CAPM formula, the expected return for this stock is 9.5%:

$$ \begin{aligned} &9.5\% = 3\% + 1.3 \times ( 8\% - 3\% ) \\ \end{aligned} $$

The expected return from the CAPM formula is used to discount future dividends and capital appreciation of the stock over the expected holding period. If the discounted value of these future cash flows equals $100, then the CAPM formula suggests that the stock is fairly valued relative to its risk.

## Problems with CAPM

Several assumptions behind the CAPM formula do not hold true in reality. Modern financial theory is built on two assumptions:

Therefore, the effectiveness of CAPM is not entirely clear. The main issue lies with Beta. When Professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French studied stock returns on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and NASDAQ, they found that differences in Beta values could not explain the performance of different stocks over the long term. The linear relationship between Beta and individual stock returns also doesn't hold in the short term. These findings seem to suggest that CAPM might be incorrect.

The assumption of including Beta in the formula is that risk can be measured through stock price volatility. However, bidirectional price movements do not represent equal risk. There is no uniform lookback period for determining stock volatility, as stock returns (and risk) are not normally distributed.

CAPM also assumes that the risk-free rate remains constant throughout the discount period. Suppose in the above example that U.S. Treasury rates rise to 5% or 6% during the 10-year holding period. The rise in risk-free rates would also increase the cost of investment and might make stocks appear overvalued.

**1960s:** The development period of CAPM.

The market portfolio used to find the market risk premium is only a theoretical value and cannot serve as a purchasable or investable substitute. In most cases, investors use major stock indices (such as the S&P 500) as a proxy for the market, which is not a perfect comparison.

The most severe criticism of CAPM is the assumption that future cash flows can be estimated in the discounting process. If investors could estimate a stock's future returns with high accuracy, CAPM would become unnecessary.

## CAPM and the Efficient Frontier

Using CAPM to construct portfolios aims to help investors manage risk. If investors could perfectly optimize portfolio returns relative to risk using CAPM, the portfolio would lie on a curve called the efficient frontier, as shown in the figure below.

The graph shows that higher expected returns (vertical axis) require higher expected risk (horizontal axis). Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) indicates that starting from the risk-free rate, portfolio expected returns increase as risk increases. Any portfolio on the Capital Market Line (CML) is superior to any possible portfolio to the right of that line, but in some cases, theoretical portfolios can be constructed on the CML to provide optimal returns for the risk taken.

While the definitions of CML and efficient frontier can be complex, they demonstrate an important concept to investors: there is a trade-off between increasing returns and increasing risk. Since it's impossible to perfectly construct portfolios that conform to the CML, investors often take on excessive risk in pursuit of higher returns.

In the figure below, you can see two portfolios constructed on the efficient frontier. Portfolio A has an expected annual return of 8% with a standard deviation or risk level of 10%. Portfolio B has an expected annual return of 10% but a standard deviation of 16%. Portfolio B's risk increases faster than its expected return.

## CAPM and Security Market Line (SML)

The efficient frontier shares the same assumptions as CAPM and can only be calculated theoretically. If a portfolio exists on the efficient frontier, it provides the maximum return for its level of risk. However, it's impossible to know whether a portfolio exists on the efficient frontier because future returns cannot be predicted.

The risk-return tradeoff applies to CAPM, and the efficient frontier diagram can be rearranged to illustrate the tradeoff between individual assets. In the diagram below, the CML is now called the Security Market Line (SML). Instead of expected risk, the horizontal axis now uses the stock's Beta value. As shown, when Beta increases from 1 to 2, the expected return also rises.

CAPM and SML establish the relationship between a stock's Beta value and its expected risk. Beta values are derived by statistically analyzing individual stock daily returns compared to market daily returns over the same time period. Higher Beta values indicate higher risk, but there may be a portfolio of high-Beta stocks where the tradeoff is acceptable when the portfolio lies on the CML, although not necessarily theoretically ideal.

The value of both models is diminished by assumptions about Beta values and market participants that don't match real market conditions. For example, Beta values don't account for the relative risk when one stock frequently experiences price declines compared to another stock with the same high Beta that doesn't experience similar declines.

## The Practical Value of CAPM

Given the criticisms of CAPM and its assumptions used in portfolio construction, it might be difficult to understand how it can be useful. However, using CAPM as a tool to evaluate the reasonableness of future expectations or make comparisons still holds some value.

Suppose an advisor proposes adding a stock priced at $100 per share to a portfolio. The advisor justifies this price using CAPM with a 13% discount rate. The investment manager can use this information to compare with the company's past performance and peers to determine if the expected 13% return is reasonable. In this example, if peer performance is above 10% while the stock's returns have consistently been 9%, the investment manager should not accept the advisor's recommendation without proper justification.

**Note:** CAPM can help generate ideas and re-evaluate holdings, but should not be the only method for valuing stocks.

Investors can also use CAPM and the efficient frontier concept to evaluate how their portfolio or individual stocks perform compared to other parts of the market. For example, suppose an investor's portfolio has achieved a 10% annual return over the past three years with a standard deviation (risk) of 10%. However, the market average return is 10% with a risk of 8%.

Investors can use this observation to reassess their portfolio construction and which holdings might not be on the SML. This might explain why the investor's portfolio is to the right of the CML. If holdings that are dragging down returns or disproportionately increasing portfolio risk can be identified, investors can take steps to make adjustments to improve returns.

Not surprisingly, CAPM has encouraged risk-averse investors to adopt index investing, which involves building a portfolio that mirrors a specific market or asset class. This is largely because CAPM conveys the message that returns above the overall market can only be achieved by taking on higher risk (Beta).

## Who Proposed CAPM?

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) was developed in the early 1960s by financial economists William Sharpe, Jack Treynor, John Lintner, and Jan Mossin, building upon the theoretical foundation established by Harry Markowitz in the 1950s.

## What are some assumptions in CAPM?

The assumptions of CAPM include:

- All investors are essentially risk-averse.
- Investors have the same time horizon for evaluating information.
- Capital can be borrowed at the risk-free rate without limitations.
- Investments can be divided into infinite portions and scales.
- There are no taxes, inflation, or transaction costs.
- Risk and return have a linear relationship.

Many of these assumptions have been criticized as unrealistic or entirely incorrect.

## What are some alternatives to CAPM?

Due to criticisms of CAPM, several alternative models have been developed to understand the relationship between risk and return in investments. One of these is the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), which looks at multiple factors, divided into macroeconomic factors or company-specific factors. Another is the Fama-French Three-Factor Model, which extends CAPM by adding company size risk and value risk factors to the market risk factor.

In 2015, Fama and French adjusted their model to include five factors. In addition to the original three factors, the new model added the concept of "profitability," indicating that companies reporting higher future earnings show higher stock market returns. The fifth factor, called "investment," relates to the concept of internal investment and returns, suggesting that companies using profits for major growth projects may face losses in the stock market.

## What is the International Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM)?

The International Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) is a financial model that applies traditional CAPM principles to international investments. It extends the CAPM concept by considering both direct and indirect risk exposures to foreign currencies, in addition to time value and market risk.

## Conclusion

CAPM uses the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory to determine whether a security is fairly valued. It relies on certain assumptions about investor behavior, risk and return distributions, and market fundamentals that don't fully align with reality.

However, the core concepts behind CAPM and the associated efficient frontier can help investors understand the relationship between expected risk and return, enabling them to make more informed decisions when adding securities to their portfolios.
