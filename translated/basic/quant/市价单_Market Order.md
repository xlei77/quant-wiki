## What is a Market Order?

A market order is an instruction from an investor to their broker to buy or sell stocks, bonds, or other assets at the best available price in the current financial market.

For most investors, market orders are the default choice for buying and selling. If the asset is a large company's stock or a popular Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), there will be numerous buyers and sellers in the market. Therefore, market orders typically execute almost instantly at a price close to the latest quote visible to the investor.[1]

Limit orders are another major option, which instruct the broker to buy or sell only at a specific price.

###

- A market order is an instruction to immediately buy or sell securities at the current market price.
- A limit order is an instruction to buy or sell only at a price specified by the investor.
- Market orders are best suited for buying and selling large-cap stocks, futures, or ETFs.
- For assets with lower trading volume or higher volatility, using limit orders is more advisable.
- Market orders are the most common type of trade in the stock market and are typically the default option on most online brokerage trading pages.

## Understanding Market Orders

When using an online broker, clicking the "Buy" or "Sell" button typically brings up an order form where users need to fill in relevant information. The form needs to know the stock symbol, whether you're buying or selling, and the number of shares. It will also ask about the order type.

The default order type is usually "Market Order." This means the investor hasn't set a price but indicates willingness to trade at the current market price. [2]

Other options include "Market-on-Close," indicating you want to trade in the last moment of the trading session, and "Limit Order," which allows you to buy only at or below a set price, or sell at or above a set price.

The Market-on-Close option suits those who believe they'll get the best price at the end of the trading day. Limit orders allow investors to step away from their computers, confident they won't miss an opportunity.

**Note:** If you think a stock is about to reach a level you consider acceptable, you might try using a limit order. If you're wrong, no trade will occur.

Market orders are the most common and simplest way to trade in the market, designed to execute quickly at the current asking price. The vast majority of stock buyers and sellers choose this option most of the time, making it the default choice.

Market orders are typically also the lowest-cost option. Some brokers charge higher fees for trades involving limit orders.

Market orders are a safe option for any large company's stock because they have extremely high liquidity. This means there are numerous stock trades happening at any moment during the trading day. Trades execute immediately. Unless the market is extremely volatile at that moment, the price you see when clicking "Buy" or "Sell" is almost identical to the final price you get.

For less liquid investments, market orders aren't as reliable, such as stocks of lesser-known or struggling small companies. Since these stocks trade infrequently, the bid-ask spread is usually larger, so market orders might execute more slowly and at disappointing prices.

## Market Orders and Limit Orders

Market orders are the most basic way to buy and sell, while limit orders give investors more control.

Limit orders allow investors to set the maximum acceptable purchase price or minimum acceptable sale price. The order will only be processed when the asset reaches that price.

Limit orders are preferable in several situations:

- When a stock trades infrequently or has high price volatility, investors can arrange to sell on the next price increase (or decrease for selling).
- If investors determine their acceptable price in advance, limit orders stand ready at all times. (Note: If you use an online broker, don't check the "Good for day" option unless you want the order to expire at the end of the trading session.)
- If investors are very certain the price won't change at the moment of completing the transaction. Stock quotes show the last price agreed upon by buyers and sellers, and the next trade could cause price fluctuation.

Limit orders are typically used by professional traders and day traders who may profit from tiny price movements by quickly buying and selling large quantities of stocks.

**Important:** Trading in large company stocks like Apple and Microsoft usually completes almost instantly without issues. However, smaller and less well-known stocks may be different.

## Market Order Example

Suppose a quality industrial company's stock has bid and ask prices of $18.50 and $20.00 respectively, with 100 shares available for sale at the asking price. If a trader places a market order to buy 500 shares, the first 100 shares will execute at $20.00.

However, the remaining 400 shares will then execute at the best asking prices that sellers are willing to accept. If trading in this stock is very thin, the remaining 400 shares might execute at $22.00 or even higher prices.

Therefore, using limit orders for certain trades is a good idea. While market order execution prices are determined by the market, limit orders give traders more control. Large stock trades can also be handled in segments to achieve the best prices.

## Special Considerations

When a trader seeks to execute a market order, they are willing to buy at the ask price or sell at the bid price. Therefore, those who place market orders immediately give up the bid-ask spread.

As such, it's a good practice to carefully examine the bid-ask spread before submitting a market orderâ€”especially for less liquid securities. Ignoring this can result in cost losses. This is particularly important for those who trade frequently or use automated trading systems.

## Common Questions About Market Orders

Here are answers to some common questions about market orders.

A market order is an instruction to a brokerage firm to buy or sell assets at the current market price. For most investors, this is also the most common way to buy and sell stocks.

A market order is essentially an instruction to make an immediate purchase or sale at the current price. It's somewhat like buying a product without negotiating the price. However, in financial markets, the fair price at any moment is determined by a large number of buy and sell orders. You will get the fair price at the current moment.

Traders can choose to set their orders as limit orders instead of market orders.

A limit order sets the maximum purchase price or minimum sale price that an investor is willing to accept. The limit order will remain there until it is executed or expires.

In online buy or sell orders, the "Good for Day" option will cancel the order at market close if the price is not reached.

Batch orders are trades executed by brokerage firms in the background. At the start of the trading day, they combine various orders for the same stock together and push them as a single trade. Batch trades can only be executed at market open and are limited to orders placed between trading sessions.

Each batch order will contain multiple market orders that were sent at some point between the trading session of the day and the previous day's closing.
