## What is a Time-Limited Order?

A time-limited order is a type of market order that requires rapid execution to achieve immediate transaction. This contrasts with "non-time-limited orders," which allow brokers certain discretion in terms of timing and price to try to obtain better execution prices for their clients.

### Key Points

- Time-limited orders are given to brokers, requiring prompt execution and immediate fulfillment, such as market orders.
- The advantage of time-limited orders is that clients can ensure the entire quantity of their order is executed without delay, whether buying or selling.
- Non-time-limited orders, on the other hand, give brokers some discretion to seek better prices for order execution.

## Understanding Time-Sensitive Orders

In most cases, trades are expected to execute at the best bid for sell orders or best offer for buy orders. Market orders are common examples of time-sensitive orders. When executing time-sensitive orders, traders have little discretion in finding prices due to time constraints. Typically, they need to match the highest bid or lowest offer to complete the transaction quickly. [1]

For example, if Apple Inc. (AAPL) has a bid-ask spread of $156.90 / $157.00, and a trader receives a time-sensitive order to buy 100 shares, they would execute at $157.00的卖价提交买单，这在正常市场情况下会立即成交。

限时订单通常用于需要调整对特定股票持仓的投资者，希望他们的订单能够迅速执行。

在某些情况下，提交限时订单并不是明智之举。比如在处理流动性较差的股票时。有些小盘股的买卖价差可能较大，如$1.50 / $2.25。使用限时订单的交易者被迫支付33.3%的价差（$0.75 / $2.25) to achieve timely execution. In this situation, if the trader had flexibility, sitting at the bid and gradually increasing the order price to attract sellers might yield a better price. Of course, 33.3% of the spread might be a reasonable choice, especially when the trader is executing a breakout trade or closing a position that resulted from an error.

**Tip:** Time-sensitive orders implicitly carry an "Immediate or Cancel" (IOC) condition.

## Uses of Time-Limited Orders

Most investors aim to get the best possible price, but time-limited orders are the ideal choice in the following three situations:
