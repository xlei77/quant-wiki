## What is Market Neutrality?

Market neutral strategies are investment approaches where investors or investment managers seek to profit from both price increases and decreases across one or more markets while attempting to completely avoid specific forms of market risk.

Market neutral strategies are typically implemented by simultaneously establishing corresponding long and short positions in different stocks, aiming to enhance returns generated through superior stock selection while reducing returns attributable to overall market volatility.

### Key Points

- Market neutrality refers to an investment strategy employed by investment managers aimed at profiting from both upward and downward price movements in financial markets.
- Investment selections in this market-neutral strategy are designed to avoid significant losses, as long and short positions hedge against each other.
- Hedge funds typically use market-neutral strategies because their investment objective is absolute returns rather than relative returns.
- The two main market-neutral strategies employed by fund managers are fundamental arbitrage and statistical arbitrage.
- Market-neutral strategies have very low positive correlation with the market because they make specific bets on stock price convergence while hedging overall market risk.

## Understanding Market Neutrality

There is no single widely accepted method for implementing market-neutral strategies. In addition to the methods mentioned above, market-neutral strategists may employ other tools such as merger arbitrage and shorting specific sectors.

Managers maintaining market-neutral positions can capitalize on any market momentum. Hedge funds typically adopt market-neutral positions because they focus on absolute returns rather than relative returns. A market-neutral position might involve establishing 50% long and 50% short positions within a specific sector (such as oil and gas) or taking similar positions across the broader market.

Generally, market-neutral strategies are similar to long/short equity funds, although there are notable differences between the two. Long/short funds aim to adjust their long and short stock exposures based on sector movements to capitalize on undervalued and overvalued opportunities.

Market-neutral strategies, however, focus on making concentrated bets based on pricing differentials, with the primary objective of achieving zero beta relative to their appropriate market index to hedge systematic risk. Although market-neutral funds use both long and short positions, the objectives of this fund category are distinctly different from typical long/short funds.

## Types of Market Neutral Strategies

Fund managers primarily employ two types of market neutral strategies: fundamental arbitrage and statistical arbitrage. Fundamental market neutral investors use fundamental analysis, rather than quantitative algorithms, to predict a company's future development and trade based on expected stock price convergence.

Statistical arbitrage market neutral funds use algorithms and quantitative methods to identify stock price discrepancies based on historical data. Then, based on these quantitative results, fund managers trade stocks that are likely to revert to their mean prices.

A major advantage of market neutral funds is their strong emphasis on mitigating market risk when constructing portfolios. During periods of high market volatility, historical data shows that market neutral funds often outperform funds using certain other strategies.

Apart from pure short-selling strategies, market neutral strategies typically have the lowest positive correlation with the market, primarily because they specifically bet on stock price convergence while hedging overall market risk.

## Market Neutral Fund Example

As a market neutral strategy, the Vanguard Market Neutral Investor Shares Fund (VMNFX) is a liquid alternative fund that operates using both long and short strategies, while the company's other mutual funds only buy and sell long positions. The fund's strategy aims to minimize the stock market's impact on its returns, meaning the fund's returns may differ significantly from market returns.

Although most funds that short stocks (such as hedge funds) do not disclose their short positions due to SEC regulations not requiring such disclosure, the Vanguard Market Neutral Investor Shares Fund does publish its short positions.

The fund selects its short positions by evaluating companies' performance in five categories: growth, quality, management decisions, market sentiment, and valuation. It then creates a composite expected return for all stocks in its investment universe and shorts the lowest-scoring stocks.

Investment in specific market neutral funds is typically targeted at high-net-worth individuals. For example, VMNFX requires a minimum investment of $50,000. Other funds may have extremely high expense ratios, far exceeding the investment ratios of passively managed funds.
