## What is Beta?

Beta (β) is the second letter of the Greek alphabet, used in finance to represent the volatility or systematic risk of a security or portfolio relative to the market, typically benchmarked against the S&P 500 index, which has a Beta value of 1.0. Stocks with Beta values higher than 1.0 are considered more volatile than the S&P 500 index.

### Key Points

- Beta (β) compares the volatility or systematic risk of a stock or portfolio to that of the market.
- Beta provides investors with an approximation of how much risk a stock will add to a portfolio.
- The S&P 500 index has a Beta value of 1.0.

## How Beta Works

The Beta coefficient shows the volatility of systematic risk of individual stocks relative to the overall market. Beta represents the slope of the regression line through data points. In finance, each point represents the return of individual stocks relative to the market.

Beta effectively describes the behavior of security returns as it responds to market volatility. It is used in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return of assets. CAPM is used to price risky securities and estimate expected returns based on the asset's risk and cost of capital.

## Calculating Beta

The Beta value of a security is calculated by dividing the product of the covariance between security returns and market returns by the variance of market returns over a specified period. This calculation helps investors understand whether a stock moves in the same direction as the rest of the market. It also provides insights into the volatility (or risk) of the stock relative to the rest of the market.

For Beta to provide useful insights, the market used as a benchmark should be relevant to the stock. For example, the Beta of a bond ETF benchmarked against the S&P 500 index would not be helpful to investors because bonds and stocks are too dissimilar.

## Beta Value

- Beta equals 1: A stock with a Beta value of 1.0 indicates that its price movement correlates with the market. Adding a stock with a Beta value of 1.0 to a portfolio won't add any risk to the portfolio, but it also won't increase the possibility of the portfolio providing excess returns.
- Beta less than 1: A Beta value less than 1.0 means that the security is less volatile than the market. Including this stock in a portfolio makes it less risky than the same portfolio without it. Utility stocks typically have lower Beta values because they move slower than the market average.
- Beta greater than 1: A Beta value greater than 1.0 indicates that the security's price is theoretically more volatile than the market. If a stock has a Beta value of 1.2, it is assumed to be 20% more volatile than the market. Technology stocks tend to have higher Beta values than the market benchmark. Adding such stocks to a portfolio will increase the portfolio's risk but may also increase its returns.
- Negative Beta: A Beta value of -1.0 means that the stock is negatively correlated with the market benchmark at a 1:1 ratio. Put options and inverse ETFs are designed to have negative Beta values. There are also some industries, such as gold mining companies, that typically have negative Beta values.

## How Investors Use Beta

Investors use Beta to measure how much risk a stock adds to their portfolio. While stocks with little deviation from the market don't add much risk to a portfolio, they also don't add potential for higher returns.

Investors must ensure they compare specific stocks against the correct benchmark and look at the R-squared value with the benchmark. R-squared is a statistical measure that compares a security's historical price movements with a benchmark index. Securities with high R-squared values indicate relevant benchmarks. Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), correlate with the performance of gold bullion.[1] Therefore, gold ETFs have low Beta values and R-squared relationships with the S&P 500 index.

Investors typically evaluate two types of risk. Systematic risk is the risk of the entire market declining, known as undiversifiable risk. Non-systematic risk or diversifiable risk is the uncertainty associated with individual stocks or industries. It is the risk associated with a company or industry that can be mitigated through diversification.

**Tip:** A stock's Beta value changes over time as it links the stock's performance to overall market returns.

## Theory and Practice

The Beta coefficient theory assumes that stock returns follow a normal distribution from a statistical perspective. In reality, returns are not always normally distributed. Therefore, a stock's Beta value may not accurately predict its future price movements.

Stocks with very low Beta values may have small price fluctuations but could still be in a long-term downward trend. Thus, adding stocks with low Beta values that are in a downward trend will only reduce portfolio risk when investors strictly define risk in terms of volatility rather than potential losses.

Similarly, stocks with high Beta values that primarily move upward will increase portfolio risk but may enhance returns. When evaluating stocks, investors also assess them from other perspectives (such as fundamental or technical factors) before assuming whether they will increase or reduce portfolio risk.

## Is Beta a Useful Indicator for Long-term Investment?

While Beta can provide useful information when evaluating stocks, it does have certain limitations. Beta can identify short-term risk in securities and analyze volatility. However, since Beta is calculated using historical data points, it has limited significance for investors hoping to predict future trends for long-term stock investments. A stock's volatility can change significantly over time, depending on the company's growth stage and other factors.

## Is Beta a Good Measure of Risk?

Beta can provide some risk information, but it is not an effective measure of risk. Beta only looks at a stock's past performance relative to the S&P 500 index, without predicting future trends. It also does not take into account the company's fundamentals or its earnings and growth potential.

## How Should Investors Interpret a Stock's Beta Value?

A stock's Beta value of 1.0 means it has the same volatility as the broader market. If the index rises or falls by 1%, then on average, the stock will do the same. A Beta value greater than 1.0 indicates higher volatility - thus, if the Beta is 1.5 and the index rises or falls by 1%, on average, the stock will move by 1.5%. A Beta value less than 1.0 indicates lower volatility: if a stock has a Beta of 0.5, it will only rise or fall by half a percentage point as the index moves 1%.

## Bottom Line

Beta (β) is the second letter of the Greek alphabet, used to measure the volatility of a security or portfolio relative to the S&P 500 index, which has a Beta value of 1.0. A Beta value of 1.0 indicates that the stock's volatility is the same as the broader market. A Beta value greater than 1.0 indicates greater volatility, while a Beta value less than 1.0 indicates lower volatility.
