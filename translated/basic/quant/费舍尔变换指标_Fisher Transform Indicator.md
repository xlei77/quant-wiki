## What is the Fisher Transform Indicator?

The Fisher Transform Indicator is a technical indicator designed to convert prices into a Gaussian normal distribution. It can highlight when prices experience extreme fluctuations and help identify turning points in asset prices based on recent price behavior. This indicator can also be used to show trends and isolate price movements within trends. The Fisher Transform Indicator was created by John F. Ehlers.

### Key Points

- The Fisher Transform indicator normalizes asset prices to make price turning points more clear.
- The indicator's formula is typically applied to prices but can also be used on other indicators.
- Some traders look for extreme readings to identify potential price reversal zones, while others focus on directional changes in the Fisher Transform indicator.
- Asset prices do not follow a normal distribution, so attempts to normalize prices through the indicator may not always provide reliable signals.

## Fisher Transform Indicator Formula and Calculation Method

$$ \begin{aligned} &\text{费舍尔变换} = \frac{1}{2}*\ln \left( \frac{1+X}{1-X} \right)\\ &\textbf{其中:}\\ &\ln \text{ 为自然对数}\\ &X = \text{价格转化为-1到1之间的水平}\\ \end{aligned} $$

Now that you understand the formula, you can calculate the Fisher Transform indicator following these steps:

## Understanding the Fisher Transform Indicator

As mentioned above, the Fisher Transform is an indicator used in technical analysis. It was developed by author, trader, and engineer John F. Ehlers. Ehlers began trading in the mid-1970s and created several indicators that traders still use today.

The Fisher Transform enables traders to create a Gaussian normal distribution. It transforms data that typically doesn't follow a normal distribution, such as market prices. Essentially, this transformation makes extreme volatility relatively rare, helping to better identify price reversals on charts.

This technical indicator is commonly used by traders seeking to identify asset price changes and trends. More specifically, traders typically prefer to look for leading signals rather than lagging indicators. Using the Fisher Transform can help traders understand asset price movements and market conditions.

## How to Apply the Fisher Transform Indicator in Trading

The Fisher Transform indicator is unbounded, meaning extreme values can persist for extended periods. Extreme values are based on the asset's historical readings. For some assets, high readings might be seven or eight, while low readings might be -4. These values may differ for other assets.

Extreme readings indicate the possibility of a reversal. Confirmation should be sought when the indicator changes direction. For example, when the indicator turns downward after reaching extremely high levels following a strong price increase, the asset price may decline (or has already begun declining).

The Fisher Transform indicator typically comes with a signal line. This is a moving average of the indicator values, thus moving slightly slower than the Fisher Transform line. Some traders use it as a trading signal when the indicator crosses the trigger line. For example, when it falls below the signal line at an extreme high, it might serve as a signal to sell current long positions.

Like many indicators, the Fisher Transform indicator generates numerous trading signals, many of which lack profit potential. Some traders prefer to combine this indicator with trend analysis. For example, during upward price movements, it can be used for buy and sell signals rather than short-selling signals. In downtrends, it can be used for short-selling signals and suggestions on when to close positions.

**Important:** The Fisher Transform can also be applied to other technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD).

## Comparison of Fisher Transform and Bollinger Bands

These two indicators appear quite different on charts, but both are based on price distribution.

Bollinger Bands use normal distribution, as they utilize standard deviation to show when prices may exceed their normal range. The Fisher Transform, on the other hand, employs Gaussian normal distribution.

The Fisher Transform appears as a separate indicator on the chart, while Bollinger Bands overlay on top of price.

## Limitations of the Fisher Transform Indicator

Although the Fisher Transform indicator is a commonly used tool by technical analysts, there are several limitations to its use. For example:

- While its purpose is to make turning points more identifiable, it can be very "noisy" at times. Extreme readings don't always accompany price reversals. Sometimes prices may move sideways or only reverse slightly.
- Determining what constitutes an extreme reading is also difficult, as these levels fluctuate over time. A reading of four might be considered high for years, but readings of eight may start occurring frequently.
- Observing all directional changes in the Fisher Transform indicator helps identify short-term price direction changes. However, signals may come too late to profit from, as many price movements can be temporary.
- Asset prices do not follow a normal distribution, so attempts to normalize prices through the indicator may have inherent flaws and may not produce reliable signals.

## Differences Between Fisher Transform Indicator and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence

The Fisher Transform Indicator and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) are two distinct technical analysis indicators. Both tools provide traders with important information about trend signals. The Fisher Transform Indicator works by transforming normalized asset prices, while MACD relies on moving averages and can be applied to trading strategies involving short-term trends. The Fisher Transform Indicator is generally considered more accurate as it provides a clearer picture of market direction.

## What is Technical Analysis?

Technical analysis is a trading strategy or discipline that uses past performance and data to identify market opportunities. Traders analyze asset prices, implied volatility, and trading volume to predict future performance. This data is used to calculate various technical indicators, which are then plotted on charts and graphs to help traders determine entry and exit points.

## What are Technical Indicators?

Technical indicators are signals used by traders in technical analysis. They rely on key asset data—specifically historical prices and trading volumes. Technical indicators are typically used to analyze short-term trends, and are also very useful for long-term traders who want to identify entry and exit points. There are many types of technical indicators, which can generally be divided into two categories: overlay indicators and oscillators. Examples include the Fisher Transform indicator, Moving Averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD).

## Summary

Indicators help technical traders find opportunities in the market. The Fisher Transform indicator is one such tool. This indicator constructs a Gaussian normal distribution by transforming prices. Its advantage lies in discovering trends and identifying price fluctuations within trends. Traders should remember that although the Fisher Transform indicator is considered a reliable tool, it should still be used in conjunction with other indicators to provide a more accurate overall picture of the market, thereby reducing the risk of potential losses.
