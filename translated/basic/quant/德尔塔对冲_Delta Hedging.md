## What is Delta Hedging?

Delta hedging is an options trading strategy aimed at reducing or hedging directional risk associated with price movements in the underlying asset. This method uses options to offset the risk exposure of either a single options position or an overall portfolio position. Investors attempt to achieve delta-neutral status to avoid directional bias in their hedge.

### Key Points

- Delta hedging is an options strategy that aims to achieve directional neutrality by establishing long and short hedge positions on the same underlying asset.
- By reducing directional risk, delta hedging can isolate volatility changes for options traders.
- Options positions can also be delta hedged using shares of the underlying stock.
- Delta hedging can benefit traders who anticipate strong volatility in the underlying stock, but this requires constant monitoring and adjustment of positions.
- Delta neutral positions can be maintained by hedging with options that have delta values opposite to current options holdings.

## How Delta Hedging Works

The most basic type of delta hedging involves investors who buy or sell options offsetting their delta risk by buying or selling corresponding amounts of stock or ETF shares. Investors may wish to offset the risk of options or underlying stocks by using delta hedging strategies.

More advanced options strategies attempt to trade volatility through delta-neutral trading strategies. Since delta hedging tries to neutralize or reduce option price movements relative to asset price movements, continuous rebalancing of the hedge is required. Delta hedging is a complex strategy primarily used by institutional traders and investment banks.

Delta represents the change in option value relative to movements in the underlying asset's market price. Hedging is an investment - usually options - used to offset risk exposure to an asset.

**Important Note:** Delta is the proportional relationship between changes in the option contract price and corresponding movements in the underlying asset's value. Therefore, if an option on XYZ stock has a delta of 0.45, when the underlying stock's market price rises by $1, the option's value will increase by $0.45, all else being equal.

Assume we're discussing options with stocks as the underlying security. Traders want to know an option's delta because it tells them how much the option or premium value will rise or fall with stock price movements. Theoretically, the delta is the change in premium for every $1 move in the underlying price, and the relationship between these two is the hedge ratio.

Call options have deltas between 0 and 1, while put options have deltas between -1 and 0. A put option with a delta of -0.50 is expected to increase in price by 50 cents when the underlying asset falls by $1. The opposite is also true; for example, a call option with a delta of 0.40 will increase in price by 40% if the underlying stock price rises by $1.

Delta depends on whether the option is:

- In-the-money or currently profitable
- At-the-money, meaning the strike price equals the market price
- Out-of-the-money, meaning currently not profitable

A put option with a delta of -0.50 is considered at-the-money, meaning the option's strike price equals the underlying stock's price. Conversely, a call option with a delta of 0.50 has a strike price equal to the stock price. [1]

## Achieving Delta Neutrality

Option positions can be hedged by using options with opposite deltas to the current option holdings to maintain a delta-neutral position. A delta-neutral position has an overall delta of zero, which minimizes the option price fluctuations relative to the underlying asset.

For example, suppose an investor holds a call option with a delta of 0.50, indicating the option is at-the-money, and wishes to maintain a delta-neutral position. The investor can purchase an at-the-money put option with a delta of -0.50 to offset the positive delta, making the position's delta zero.

**Note:** Delta-gamma hedging is closely related to delta hedging. It is an options strategy that combines delta and gamma hedging to mitigate risks from both underlying asset movements and changes in delta itself.

## Brief Introduction to Options

The value of an option is measured by its premium, which is the fee paid when purchasing the contract. By holding options, investors or traders can exercise their right to buy or sell 100 shares of the underlying asset, but they are not required to do so if it's not profitable. The price at which the purchase or sale occurs is called the strike price, which is set at the time of purchase (along with the expiration date). Each contract equals 100 shares of the underlying stock or asset.

Holders of American-style options can exercise their rights at any time before the expiration date. European-style options only allow holders to exercise on the expiration date. Additionally, depending on the option's value, holders of both types can choose to sell their contracts to other investors before expiration.[2]

For example, if a call option has a strike price of $30, and the underlying stock is trading at $40 at expiration, the option holder can exchange 100 shares at the lower strike price of $30. If they choose, they can then turn around and sell these on the open market at $40, thereby making a profit. The profit amount would be $10 minus the call option premium and brokerage fees for executing the trades.

Put options are slightly more complex but operate very similarly to call options. In this case, the holder expects the value of the underlying asset to deteriorate before expiration. They may either hold the asset in their portfolio or borrow shares from a broker.[3]

## Using Stocks for Delta Hedging

Options positions can also be delta hedged using shares of the underlying stock. One share of the underlying stock has a delta of 1 because the stock's value changes by $1. For example, suppose an investor holds a call option with a delta of 0.75.

In this case, the investor can hedge this call option by short selling 75 shares of the underlying stock. When short selling, the investor borrows shares, sells them at market price to other investors, and later buys back the shares at hopefully lower prices to return to the lender. [4]

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Delta Hedging

Delta hedging can benefit traders when they expect strong movements in the underlying stock, but there is a risk of over-hedging if the stock doesn't move as anticipated. If over-hedged positions need to be unwound, trading costs will increase.

A major disadvantage of delta hedging is the necessity for constant monitoring and adjustment of positions. Based on stock volatility, traders need to frequently buy and sell securities to avoid under- or over-hedging situations.

The volume of trades involved in delta hedging can result in high costs, as trading fees are incurred when adjusting positions. This is particularly expensive when hedging with options, as options can lose time value and sometimes trade at prices lower than the underlying stock's movement.

Time value is a measure of the remaining time before option expiration during which traders can profit. As time passes and expiration approaches, options lose time value because there is less time available to profit. Therefore, the time value of options affects their premium cost, as options with higher time value typically have higher premiums, while options with lower time value usually have lower premiums. As time passes, changes in option values may necessitate more delta hedging to maintain delta-neutral strategies.[5]

#### Advantages

- Allows traders to hedge against adverse price movements in their portfolio
- Protects profits from option or stock positions in the short term without having to exit long-term holdings

#### Disadvantages

- May require numerous trades to continuously adjust delta hedging, leading to increased costs
- Over-hedging may occur if delta is excessively offset or if market changes are unexpected

## Delta Hedging Example

Suppose a trader wants to maintain a delta-neutral position for their investment in General Electric (GE) stock. The investor holds a put option on GE. One option contract represents 100 shares of GE stock.

The stock dropped significantly, and the trader profited from the put option. Subsequently, recent events drove the stock price up. However, the trader believes this upward movement is a short-term event and expects the stock to decline again. Therefore, they implement delta hedging to protect the gains from the put option.

The put option's delta for GE is -0.75, commonly referred to as -75. The investor establishes a delta-neutral position by purchasing 75 shares of the underlying stock. At $10 per share, the investor spends a total of $750 to buy 75 shares of GE stock. When the recent stock price increase ends or events turn favorable for the trader's put option position, the investor can unwind the delta hedge.

## How Does Delta Hedging Work?

Delta hedging is a trading strategy involving options. Traders use it to hedge directional risk associated with changes in the underlying asset's price, typically by offsetting options positions through buying or selling equivalent amounts of stocks or ETF shares. The goal is to achieve delta neutrality without creating directional bias in the hedge.

## Can Delta Be Used to Determine How to Hedge Options?

Yes, options can be hedged using Delta. To do this, you must determine whether to buy or sell the underlying asset. You can determine the quantity needed for Delta hedging by multiplying the total Delta value by the number of option contracts involved. Multiply this number by 100 to get the final result.

## What is Delta-Gamma Hedging?

Delta-gamma hedging is an options strategy closely related to delta hedging. In delta-gamma hedging, delta and gamma hedging are combined to reduce the risk associated with changes in the underlying asset while also aiming to minimize the risk of delta itself. Remember that delta estimates the change in derivative price, while gamma describes the rate of change in the option's delta for each point movement in price.

## Summary

Option traders have multiple strategies to help mitigate risks associated with these investments. One of these is delta hedging. When traders employ this strategy, their goal is to reduce directional risk related to price movements in the underlying asset. This is achieved by buying or selling options and offsetting the risk with an equivalent amount of company shares or ETF shares. While this can be beneficial for traders who understand how to use this strategy, traders should be aware that it requires constant monitoring and can be quite expensive.
