Benjamin Graham was a highly influential investor in the first half of the 20th century. His work in securities research laid the foundation for the in-depth fundamental valuation methods adopted by today's market participants in stock market analysis. His classic work "The Intelligent Investor" is widely regarded as the foundational text of value investing.

### Key Points

- Graham earned approximately $500,000 annually by age 25, but lost almost all his income and investments in the 1929 stock market crash.
- The 1929 market crash inspired Graham to co-author a research book with David Dodd titled "Security Analysis."
- In 1949, Graham published "The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing," which is considered the bible for investors.
- As a lecturer at Columbia University, Graham mentored and taught Warren Buffett, who is now a billionaire investor.

## Early Life and Education

Benjamin Graham was born in London, England in 1894. In his early years, his family moved to the United States, where they lost all their savings during the bank panic of 1907. Graham earned a scholarship to Columbia University, and after graduation, he accepted a job offer from the Wall Street firm Newburger, Henderson, and Loeb.

By age 25, his annual income had reached approximately $500,000. However, the 1929 stock market crash nearly wiped out all of his investments, an experience that taught him valuable lessons about the investment world. His observations after the crash inspired him to co-author "Security Analysis" with David Dodd. Notable American investor Irving Kahn also contributed to the research content of this book.

## Major Achievements

Benjamin Graham is regarded as the founder of stock analysis, particularly value investing. According to Graham and Dodd, value investing involves deriving the intrinsic value of common stocks independent of market prices and comparing it with the stock's market value. Intrinsic value can be determined through a company's financial fundamentals, including:

- Assets
- Earnings
- Dividend payments

If the intrinsic value is higher than the current price, investors should buy and hold until the market reverts to the mean. Mean reversion theory suggests that over time, market prices and intrinsic prices converge until the stock price reflects its true value. By purchasing undervalued stocks, investors buy at prices below their true value and sell when prices reach their intrinsic value.

This price convergence effect only occurs in efficient markets. Graham was a strong advocate of efficient markets. If markets are not efficient, value investing loses its meaning: the fundamental principle of value investing relies on the market eventually correcting to intrinsic value.

Despite irrational behavior among investors, common stocks will not remain perpetually overvalued or undervalued.

Graham noted that due to investors' irrational behavior and factors such as unpredictable future and market volatility, buying undervalued or unpopular stocks can provide investors with a margin of safety—room for human error.

Additionally, investors can achieve a margin of safety by buying stocks of companies with high dividend yields and low debt ratios, and by diversifying their portfolios. If a company goes bankrupt, this margin of safety will mitigate investor losses. Graham typically used stocks trading at two-thirds of their net value as a buffer for the margin of safety.

The original Graham formula for finding a stock's intrinsic value was:

$$ \begin{aligned}&V \ =\ EPS \ \times\ (8.5\ +\ 2g)\\&\textbf{其中:}\\& V\ =\ \text{内在价值}\\&EPS\ =\ \text{公司过去12个月的每股收益}\\&8.5\ =\ \text{零增长股票的市盈率}\\&g\ =\ \text{公司的长期增长率}\end{aligned} $$

In 1974, the formula was revised to include a 4.4% risk-free rate, which was the average yield of high-grade corporate bonds in 1962, and used the letter Y to represent the current yield on AAA corporate bonds:

$$ V=\frac{EPS\ \times\ (8.5\ +\ 2g)\ \times\ 4.4}{Y} $$

"Security Analysis" was first published in 1934, during the early Great Depression, when Graham was a lecturer at Columbia Business School. This book established the basic framework for value investing, including buying undervalued stocks with potential for long-term growth. In an era when the stock market was viewed as a speculative tool, the concepts of intrinsic value and margin of safety first introduced in "Security Analysis" paved the way for fundamental stock analysis without speculative elements.

In 1949, Graham wrote the acclaimed "The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing." The book is widely considered the bible for value investors and introduced a character called "Mr. Market" as Graham's metaphor for how market prices work.

Mr. Market is the investor's imaginary business partner who tries to sell or buy his shares at different prices each day, often related to his emotional state. Of course, the investor doesn't need to accept any buy or sell offers.

Graham pointed out that investors should not rely on daily market sentiment driven by investor emotions (greed and fear), but should analyze stock value based on company operations and financial conditions. This analysis should strengthen investors' judgment when facing Mr. Market's quotes.

According to Graham, intelligent investors sell to optimists and buy from pessimists. Investors should watch closely for price-value disparities created by economic recessions, market crashes, one-time events, temporary negative publicity, and human error, looking for opportunities to buy low and sell high. If no such opportunities exist, investors should ignore market noise.

While reaffirming the basic principles from "Security Analysis," "The Intelligent Investor" also advised investors to:

- Not follow the crowd
- Maintain a portfolio of 50% stocks and 50% bonds or cash
- Be wary of day trading
- Take advantage of market fluctuations
- Not buy a stock merely because it's popular
- Understand market fluctuations are inevitable and can be turned to investors' advantage
- Watch for creative accounting techniques companies use to make their earnings per share more attractive

Notably, Warren Buffett was one of Benjamin Graham's outstanding disciples. Buffett was Graham's student at Columbia University and worked for Graham's company, Graham-Newman Corporation, until Graham's retirement. Under Graham's guidance and value investing principles, Buffett became one of history's most successful investors, with wealth reaching approximately $120.6 billion as of January 2024, ranking eighth globally. Other significant investors who studied and worked under Graham's guidance include Irving Kahn, Christopher Browne, and Walter Schloss.

Although Benjamin Graham passed away in 1976, his research findings remain widely used among value investors and financial analysts who continue to conduct fundamental research based on companies' value and growth prospects.
