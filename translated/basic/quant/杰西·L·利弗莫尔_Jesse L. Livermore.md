### Key Points

## Early Life and Education

Jesse L. Livermore was born on July 26, 1877, in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. Due to his family's poverty, Livermore only completed elementary school.

At age 14, he started working at Paine Webber & Co. in Boston as a quotation board boy, responsible for recording stock exchange prices on ticker tape and copying them onto the blackboard.

## Stock Trader

In his work "Jesse Livermore: The Man Who Sold America Short," Tom Rubython describes Livermore as a trader who experienced both the highest single-day profits and losses. Between 1900 and 1940, Jesse Livermore made and lost three fortunes. Livermore bought and held stocks during bull markets, and chose to sell when market momentum changed. Given that companies did not publish financial data or conduct fundamental analysis at the time, his strategy proved remarkably precise.

At age 15, Livermore made his first trade with a profit of $3. [1] At 16, he quit his job at Paine Webber and began trading independently. Most trading at that time took place in bucket shops, where clients gambled on stock prices using high leverage. After being banned from Boston's bucket shops due to his consistent success, Livermore relocated to New York City. [1]

## Wall Street's Short Seller

Jesse L. Livermore gained his reputation on Wall Street for predicting market crashes, earning him the title "Wall Street's Short Seller."[2] His two most famous trades occurred during the 1907 financial crisis and the early stages of the Great Depression.

As the market bubble expanded in 1906, Livermore followed the trend until his intuition told him to seek another direction. In one famous trade, he shorted Union Pacific stock and made $300,000 in two days following the San Francisco earthquake. During the 1907 market crash, Livermore followed J.P. Morgan's advice and chose to buy while others were selling. Other traders followed suit, and Livermore was credited with playing a crucial role in the market's early recovery.[3]

By 1929, Livermore was well-positioned in the stock market but began looking for the first signs of market weakness as another bubble approached. In several small trades, Livermore tested the market with short bets while selling his long positions, losing nearly $250,000. However, Livermore continued building short positions, and on "Black Tuesday," October 29, 1929, he reportedly made $100 million shorting during the Great Depression.[3]

Reports suggest Livermore's peak wealth was equivalent to $1.5 billion in today's terms. He traded freely and without regulation until the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1934, which marked the end of Livermore's era.[4] By 1940, Livermore was bankrupt.

## Who Did Jesse L. Livermore Influence?

When discussing Livermore's experiences, William J. O'Neil - founder of Investor's Business Daily - stated: "In my 45 years of experience, I've only found 10 to 12 truly valuable books, and 'Reminiscences of a Stock Operator' is one of them." Today, many people in the market know Jesse Livermore through an anonymous Twitter account of the same name that discusses and recommends Livermore's trading strategies.

## How Did the White House Influence Jesse L. Livermore's Trading?

In the unregulated market, Livermore manipulated the cotton market after World War I. He built cotton positions through brokers worldwide, and within 18 months, he owned most of America's cotton. President Woodrow Wilson had requested Livermore to sell his dominant position to avoid damaging the U.S. economy.[5]

## How Did J.P. Morgan Influence Jesse L. Livermore?

During the Financial Crisis of 1907, Livermore made $1 million in profits in a single day through short positions. When prominent banker J.P. Morgan persuaded him to close his positions for the sake of national interest, Livermore complied. Subsequently, he earned an additional $3 million in profits when the market rebounded.

## Summary

Jesse L. Livermore's rise from a quotation board clerk to a Wall Street legend continues to offer insights to investors today. His experience serves as a historical record of unregulated stock trading in the early 20th century.
