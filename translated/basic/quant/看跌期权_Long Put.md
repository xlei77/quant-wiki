## What is a Long Put Option?

A long put option refers to buying a put option, typically with the expectation that the price of the underlying asset will decline. Here, "long" does not refer to the length of time until expiration, but rather indicates that the trader is taking a position with the hope of selling the option at a higher price in the future.

Traders may purchase put options for speculative purposes, betting that the price of the underlying asset will fall, which would increase the value of the put option. Put options can also be used to hedge long positions in the underlying asset. If the price of the underlying asset falls, the value of the put option increases, helping to offset losses in the underlying asset.

### Key Points

- A put option refers to when someone buys a put option. This in itself is a bearish market strategy.
- If investors believe that the price of a security will fall, they will buy put options.
- Investors may choose to buy put options to speculate on price declines or hedge against downside risk in their portfolio.
- Using put option strategies can therefore limit downside risk.

## Understanding Put Options

A put option has a strike price, which is the price at which the put option buyer can sell the underlying asset. Suppose the underlying asset is a stock and the option's strike price is $50. This means the put option gives the trader the right to sell the stock at $50, even if the stock price falls to $20. On the other hand, if the stock rises and stays above $50, the option becomes worthless because there's no point in selling the stock at $50 when it's trading at $60.

If traders wish to exercise their right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price, they can exercise the option. Exercising the option is not mandatory, and traders can exit by selling the option at any time before expiration.

For American options, traders can exercise before the expiration date, while European options can only be exercised on the expiration date. If early exercise is chosen or the option is in-the-money at expiration, the option holder will have a short position in the underlying asset.

## Put Option Strategy vs Short Selling Stock

For bearish investors, put options may be a more attractive strategy than short selling stocks. The theoretical risk of short selling stocks is unlimited because there is no upper limit to stock prices. Meanwhile, the profit potential of short selling stocks is limited, as stocks cannot fall below $0 per share. Put options have similar profit potential to short selling stocks, as profits are likewise limited. The value of a put option will only increase if the underlying stock falls to zero. The advantage of put options is that the risk is limited to the premium paid for the option.

The disadvantage of put options is that the price of the underlying asset must fall before the option expiration date, otherwise the amount paid will be lost.

To profit from short selling stocks, traders sell stocks at a certain price hoping to buy them back at a lower price. Put options work similarly - if the underlying stock falls, the value of the put option increases and can be sold for a profit. If the option is exercised, it will place the trader in a short position on the underlying stock, and the trader will then need to purchase the underlying stock to realize the profit from the trade.

## Using Put Options for Hedging

Put options can also be used to hedge against unpredictable movements in long stock positions. This hedging strategy is known as a protective put or married put.

For example, suppose an investor holds a long position of 100 shares of Bank of America Corporation (BAC) at $25 per share. Although the investor is bullish on the stock in the long term, they are concerned about potential stock price declines over the next month. Therefore, the investor purchases a put option with a strike price of $20, paying $0.10 (multiplied by 100 shares, as each put option represents 100 shares), which will expire in one month.

The investor's hedge limits the loss to $500, or 100 shares × ($25 - $20), minus the premium paid for the put option (total of $10). In other words, even if Bank of America falls to $0 next month, this trader can lose a maximum of $510, as all stock losses below $20 are covered by the put option.

## Example of Using Put Options

Suppose Apple Inc. (AAPL) is trading at $170 per share, and you believe the price might drop by about 10% before a new product launch. You decide to buy 10 put options with a strike price of $155, paying $0.45 per option. Your total investment in put options is $450 plus fees and commissions (1,000 shares × $0.45 = $450).

If Apple stock falls to $154 before expiration, your put options are now worth $1.00 each because you can exercise the options to short 1,000 shares at $155 and immediately buy them back at $154 to hedge.

Your put options are now worth $1,000 in total (minus any fees and commissions), calculated as (1,000 shares × $1.00 = $1,000). Your return on this position is 122% = ($1,000 - $450)/$450. By buying put options, you achieved a return far greater than the 9.4% decline in the underlying stock price.

Conversely, if Apple stock rises to $200, these 10 option contracts will expire worthless, causing you to lose your initial investment of $450.
