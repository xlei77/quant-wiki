## What is a Short Position?

A short position or short selling refers to when a trader first sells a security with the plan to later buy it back or close the position at a lower price. Traders may choose to take a short position when they believe the price of the security is likely to decline in the near future. There are two types of short positions: naked shorts and covered shorts.

A naked short is when a trader sells short without actually possessing the security. However, this practice is illegal for stocks in the United States. In India and some other countries, this practice is completely prohibited. A covered short is when a trader borrows shares from a stock lending department; in return, the trader must pay borrowing interest rates while maintaining the short position.

In futures or forex markets, short positions can be established at any time.

### Key Points

- A short position is a trading technique where investors sell securities first, planning to buy them back later.
- Short strategies are suitable when investors expect security prices to decline in the short term.
- Typically, short sellers borrow stocks from investment banks or other financial institutions and pay borrowing fees during the period they hold the short position.

## Understanding Short Positions

When creating a short position, it's essential to understand that while a trader's profit potential is limited, potential losses are unlimited. This is because the profit potential is limited to the stock price approaching zero. However, a stock's price can continue to rise over several years, forming a series of higher highs. One of the most dangerous aspects of short trading is the possibility of a short squeeze.

A short squeeze occurs when the price of a heavily shorted stock suddenly begins to rise, causing short traders to rush to close their positions. A famous short squeeze occurred in October 2008, when Volkswagen's stock price surged as short sellers scrambled to buy shares to close their positions. During this short squeeze, the stock price skyrocketed from approximately €200 to €1000, achieving a massive gain in just over a month.

## How to Establish a Short Position

To place a short order, investors must first obtain access to such orders in their brokerage account. Since short selling involves margin and interest charges, you need to have a margin account to establish a short position. Once you have the correct type of account and necessary permissions, you can enter the order details on the order page just like any other trade.

Remember that you sell first to open the position, hoping to buy back the asset at a lower price in the future. In a short position, the entry price is the selling price, while the exit price is the buying price. Also understand that margin trading involves interest, margin requirements, and potential other brokerage fees.

## Short Position Example

Suppose a trader believes that Amazon's stock may decline after the release of its quarterly earnings report. To capitalize on this possibility, the trader borrows 1000 shares from their stock lending department, planning to short sell.

The trader then sells these 1000 shares at $1,500 per share. In the following weeks, the company reports lower-than-expected earnings and provides disappointing guidance for the next quarter. As a result, the stock price plummets to $1,300; the trader immediately buys to close the position. This trade yields a profit of $200 per share, resulting in a total profit of $200,000.

## What is Margin?

In finance, margin refers to the collateral that investors must deposit with their broker or exchange to cover the credit risk posed by the holder to the broker or exchange. For example, it is not possible to establish a short position without sufficient margin.

According to Regulation T, the Federal Reserve Board requires all short accounts to maintain a margin of 150% of the short sale value at the time of initiating the short sale. This 150% includes 100% of the sale proceeds (i.e., the full value of the short sale), plus an additional margin requirement of 50% of the short sale value.[1]

## How Much Can You Lose on a Short Position?

Short selling refers to when a trader borrows a security and sells it in the open market, planning to buy it back later at a lower price. Theoretically, there is no upper limit to how high an asset's price can rise - it can increase infinitely. This means that, in theory, the risk of loss on a short position is unlimited.

## What is a Short Squeeze?

A short position represents borrowed stocks that have been sold, with investors expecting to buy them back in the future. When the price of the underlying asset rises, investors face losses on their short positions. Besides the increasing pressure from paper losses, maintaining short positions may become more difficult because if the price of the underlying asset rises, the required margin as collateral also increases to ensure investors can buy back the stocks and return them to the broker.

When investors are forced to buy back stocks to close their positions, we call this a short squeeze. If enough short sellers are forced to buy back stocks simultaneously, this can lead to a surge in demand for the stock, causing the price of the underlying asset to rise sharply.

## Summary

Although selling something you don't own sounds illegal, the market is strictly regulated. When traders believe a security's price may fall in the short term, they can enter a short position by selling the security first, planning to buy it back later at a lower price.

To establish a short position, traders typically need to borrow shares of the security from their brokerage firm. This means short selling requires a margin account along with other potential permissions and brokerage fees.

If the price of the shorted security starts to rise instead of fall, losses can increase rapidly. In fact, since there is no upper limit to security prices, losses on a short position are theoretically unlimited. Given these inherent risks and the complexity of the transaction, short selling securities is typically recommended only for more advanced traders and investors.
