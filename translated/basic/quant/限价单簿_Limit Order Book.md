## What is a Limit Order Book?

A limit order book is a record of unfilled limit orders maintained by securities specialists responsible for exchanges. A limit order is an order to buy or sell securities at a specified price or better. A buy limit order means buying at a preset price or lower, while a sell limit order means selling securities at a preset price or higher.

When a securities limit order is entered, it is recorded by the specialist. As buy and sell limit orders are added, the specialist records all relevant orders in the limit order book. When the market price reaches the preset limit price, the specialist executes these orders at or below the limit price.

### Key Points

- The limit order book is a record of unfilled limit orders maintained by the exchange's securities specialist.
- A limit order is an order to buy or sell securities at a specific price or better.
- When a limit order for a security is entered, the specialist records it.
- As buy and sell limit orders for securities are issued, the specialist records all these orders in the limit order book.

## Understanding the Limit Order Book

The specialist responsible for managing the limit order book ensures that priority orders are executed before others and completed ahead of orders at the same or worse prices submitted by other traders (such as floor brokers and market makers).

The specialist profits from the spread between buy and sell orders in their limit order book. With advances in trading system technology, this process has evolved from manual operations to large-scale automated trading.

## Tracking Limit Orders

In 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began creating a centralized limit order book, a system that electronically tracks limit orders on exchanges.[1] This electronic order tracking system can automatically match the best order pairs in the system to execute trades. The best order pair consists of the highest bid price and the lowest ask price.

The bid price is the price at which securities specialists or exchanges are willing to sell securities, or the price at which investors can buy securities. The ask price, also called the offer price, is the price at which securities specialists or exchanges are willing to buy securities, or the price at which investors can sell securities.

When a limit order is entered into the trading system and processed by the specialist or electronic order database responsible for that order book, it remains valid in the system until it can be matched with a suitable trade and executed. Buy limit orders are placed within the upper price range. An investor would say: "I don't want to pay more than $X for this stock to sell this stock."

## Limit Order Qualifying Conditions

Limit orders can include "qualifying conditions." If an order has no qualifying conditions, the request is only valid during market trading hours, known as a "day order," and may expire without execution or with only partial execution.

If an investor's order is "buy 10,000 shares at $32买入10,000股XYZ普通股”，则表示他们请求以$32 or better," this represents the order's qualifying condition.

If an investor's strategy requires completing an order for 10,000 shares at any time at the requested price or better, the request can be entered as "buy 10,000 shares of XYZ at $32 GTC." A "Good Till Canceled" order instructs the market to continue buying these shares until the order is canceled, even if each purchase is only 100 shares and continues for several weeks. The investor wants the order executed regardless of how long it takes the market to complete it.

Another qualifying condition is AON, meaning "All or None." An investor may not want only partial execution of the order, so this condition instructs the market to execute the order only when all 10,000 shares requested can be fulfilled, otherwise no purchase is made.

There are other types of order qualifying conditions that allow investors to ensure trades are executed according to their specific investment objectives, and in each case define the "limits" that investors impose on the market.

## Special Considerations

If the market price reaches a preset level and triggers the order, investors will receive the requested price. However, limit orders do not guarantee execution. In other words, the order can only be completed when the price reaches the limit price. Limit orders are helpful to investors because they ensure that investors will not pay more for securities than the preset price initially established.
