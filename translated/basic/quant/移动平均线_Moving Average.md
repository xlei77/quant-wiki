## What is Moving Average (MA)?

In finance, Moving Average (MA) is a commonly used technical analysis indicator for stocks. The calculation of moving averages aims to smooth price data by creating a constantly updated average price.

By calculating moving averages, the impact of random and short-term fluctuations on stock prices within a specific timeframe is reduced. Simple Moving Average (SMA) uses the arithmetic mean of prices over a certain period, while Exponential Moving Average (EMA) assigns greater weight to more recent prices.

### Key Points

- Moving Average (MA) is a commonly used stock indicator in technical analysis.
- Moving averages help smooth out price data over a specific period by creating a constantly updated average price.
- Simple Moving Average (SMA) is calculated as the arithmetic mean of a set of prices over a specific number of past days.
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a weighted average that gives greater importance to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.

## Understanding Moving Average (MA)

Moving averages are calculated to identify a stock's trend direction or determine its support and resistance levels. It is a trend-following or lagging indicator because it is based on past prices.

The longer the period of the moving average, the more pronounced the lag effect. A 200-day moving average has a much greater lag effect than a 20-day moving average because it contains prices from the past 200 days. The values of 50-day and 200-day moving averages are widely watched by investors and traders and are considered important trading signals.

Investors can choose different period lengths to calculate moving averages based on their trading objectives. Shorter moving averages are typically used for short-term trading, while longer-term moving averages are more suitable for long-term investors.

Although it's impossible to predict the future movement of a specific stock, using technical analysis and research can help make better predictions. An rising moving average indicates that a security is in an upward trend, while a falling moving average indicates a downward trend.

Similarly, upward momentum is confirmed through bullish crossovers, where the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average. Conversely, downward momentum is confirmed through bearish crossovers, where the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

## Types of Moving Averages

Simple Moving Average (SMA) is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of a set of values over a specific time period. Add a group of numbers or stock prices together, then divide by the number of prices. The formula for calculating a security's simple moving average is as follows:

$$ \begin{aligned} &SMA = \frac{ A_1 + A_2 + \cdots + A_n }{ n } \\ &\textbf{其中:} \\ &A = \text{第 } n \text{ 期的平均值} \\ &n = \text{时间周期的数量} \\ \end{aligned} $$

A graph of 50-day stock prices using simple moving average might look like this:

Exponential Moving Average (EMA) gives more weight to recent prices to make it more responsive to new information. To calculate EMA, first calculate the Simple Moving Average (SMA) for a specific period.

Then calculate the multiplier used for weighting the EMA, known as the "smoothing factor," which is typically calculated as: [2/(Selected Time Period + 1)].

For a 20-day moving average, the multiplier would be [2/(20+1)] = 0.0952. The smoothing factor is combined with the previous EMA to arrive at the current value. Thus, EMA assigns higher weights to recent prices, while SMA assigns equal weights to all values.

$$ \begin{aligned} &EMA_t = \left [ V_t \times \left ( \frac{ s }{ 1 + d } \right ) \right ] + EMA_y \times \left [ 1 - \left ( \frac { s }{ 1 + d} \right ) \right ] \\ &\textbf{其中:}\\ &EMA_t = \text{今日EMA} \\ &V_t = \text{今日值} \\ &EMA_y = \text{昨日EMA} \\ &s = \text{平滑} \\ &d = \text{天数} \\ \end{aligned} $$

## Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

EMA calculation assigns greater weight to recent data points. Therefore, EMA is considered a form of weighted average calculation.

In the figure below, both averages use a period of 15, but EMA responds more quickly to price changes than SMA. When prices rise, EMA values are higher than SMA, and when prices fall, EMA declines more rapidly than SMA. This sensitivity to price changes is the main reason why some traders prefer to use EMA.

## Moving Average Examples

The calculation of moving averages varies by type: SMA or EMA. Below is an example of a Simple Moving Average (SMA) for a security's closing prices over 15 days:

- Week 1 (5 days): 20, 22, 24, 25, 23
- Week 2 (5 days): 26, 28, 26, 29, 27
- Week 3 (5 days): 28, 30, 27, 29, 28

A 10-day moving average will average the closing prices of the previous 10 days to create the first data point. The next data point will remove the earliest price, add the 11th day's price, and recalculate the average.

The Bollinger Bands® technical indicator typically places the bands at two standard deviations from the simple moving average. Generally, movement toward the upper band suggests the asset may be overbought, while approaching the lower band indicates the asset may be oversold. Since standard deviation is a statistical measure of volatility, this indicator adjusts according to market conditions.

## What Does a Moving Average Indicate?

A moving average is a statistical measure that captures the average change of a data series over time. In finance, moving averages are commonly used by technical analysts to track price trends of specific securities. An upward trend in the moving average may indicate an increase in the security's price or momentum, while a downward trend is viewed as a signal of decline.

## What is the Purpose of Moving Averages?

Moving averages are widely used in technical analysis, which aims to understand and utilize price movement patterns of securities and indices. Typically, technical analysts use moving averages to detect changes in security momentum, such as sudden price drops. Sometimes, they use moving averages to confirm their suspicions about potential changes.

## What are examples of moving averages?

The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a type of moving average that assigns greater weight to more recent trading days. This type of moving average may be more useful for short-term traders, as longer-term historical data may be less relevant for them. Simple Moving Average calculates the average of a series of prices while assigning equal weight to all prices.

## What is MACD?

Traders use the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to monitor the relationship between two moving averages, calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average from the 12-day exponential moving average. MACD also employs a signal line, which helps identify crossover points, represented by a 9-day exponential moving average plotted on the same chart as the MACD line.

The signal line helps identify changes in security price trends and confirms trend strength. When MACD is positive, the short-term average is above the long-term average, indicating upward momentum; when the short-term average falls below the long-term average, it indicates downward momentum.

## What is a Golden Cross?

A golden cross is a chart pattern where a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. It is a bullish breakout pattern formed when a security's short-term moving average (such as the 15-day moving average) crosses above its long-term moving average (such as the 50-day moving average). Since longer-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross signals a bullish market outlook and is often accompanied by high trading volume.

## Conclusion

Moving Average (MA) is a commonly used stock indicator in technical analysis that smooths price data by creating a continuously updated average price. An upward-moving average indicates that a security is in an upward trend, while a downward-moving average signals a downward trend.

Generally, Exponential Moving Average is superior to Simple Moving Average because it assigns higher weights to recent prices and responds more clearly to new information and trends.
