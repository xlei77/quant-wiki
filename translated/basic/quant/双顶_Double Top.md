## What is a Double Top?

A double top is a highly bearish technical reversal pattern that typically forms when an asset's price reaches a high point twice, with a moderate pullback between the two peaks. This pattern is confirmed when the asset price breaks below the support line formed by the low point between the two highs.

### Key Points

- Double top is a bearish technical reversal pattern.
- It's not always easy to identify as it requires confirmation of support level breakdown.
- While double top is a bearish signal, double bottom is a bullish signal.
- Double tops typically include an uptrend, initial peak, trough, second peak, and neckline.
- Investors can enter short positions after price breaks below support, or trade in smaller size, as profit potential from double tops may be limited.

## What Does a Double Top Tell You?

A double top signal indicates a change in the medium to long-term trend of an asset class. Let's look at several historical examples of double tops.

The chart above shows Amazon Inc. (AMZN) stock, displaying a double top formation around $2,050 between September and October 2018. In this case, the critical support level was around $1,880. Although the stock price fell nearly 8% from October's high to the support level of $1,880, the double top couldn't be confirmed until the price broke below $1,880. Subsequently, the stock price plummeted by nearly 31%.[1]

In the next example using Netflix Inc. (NFLX), we see what appears to be a double top formation. However, in this case, we observe that the support level wasn't broken, and the stock continued to rise with the trend. Later in the chart, though, we can see the stock formed another apparent double top in June and July. This time it did become a reversal pattern, with the stock breaking below the $380 support level, leading to a 39% decline to $231 in December. Additionally, note that the $380 support level acted as resistance twice during the November rally.[2]

## Differences Between Double Tops and Double Bottoms

A double top is a bearish reversal pattern that occurs after an uptrend. It consists of two peaks of almost equal height close to each other, with a valley in between. This pattern indicates that the price has twice reached a resistance level but failed to break through. Traders typically view this pattern as a signal to sell or short, anticipating further market decline.

Almost opposite to this is the double bottom. After a downtrend, a double bottom is a bullish reversal pattern. It consists of a peak between two troughs of almost equal depth. This pattern indicates that the price has found support at a particular level and failed to break lower.

In many ways, double tops and double bottoms look very similar, with the only difference being in the peaks. Double tops produce consecutive "highs," while double bottoms produce consecutive "lows."

**Important Note:** Be aware that double tops can generate false signals. Even the strongest patterns can break out in the opposite direction of their normal path.

## How to Identify Double Tops

There are several key steps to identify double tops. Note that not every instance of a double top is exactly the same, and false signals may lead investors to mistakenly believe a double top is forming. Generally, the following are the steps to identify double tops.

## Key Elements of Double Top Pattern

When identifying a double top pattern, consider the following key elements:

- Uptrend: Before the pattern forms, price should show clear upward movement, characterized by higher highs and higher lows.
- Two Peaks: The pattern includes two peaks that are roughly equal in price. These peaks act as resistance levels where price stalls and begins to decline.
- Valley: A valley forms between the two peaks. This represents a temporary price pullback or consolidation period.
- Neckline: The neckline is a horizontal line formed by connecting the low point of the valley. It serves as a support level crucial for confirming the pattern.
- Neckline Breakout: The breakout of the neckline is a critical component of the double top pattern. The pattern is confirmed when price breaks below the neckline, indicating a possible trend reversal.
- Volume: Volume can enhance understanding of the pattern. Typically, volume increases when price breaks below the neckline, while volume decreases during the formation of the two peaks. The increase in volume during the breakdown may strengthen the validity of the pattern.
- Price Target: After the breakdown, use the distance extended below the neckline as a reference point. This can provide a rough reference for price decline.

**Note:** The time interval between the two peaks can vary. A double top might have a week between its two peaks, while another might take several months.

## How to Trade Double Tops

There are three main ways to trade double tops. First, you can wait for the price to break below the neckline, which confirms the double top pattern and may signal a trend reversal. After the breakout occurs, you can initiate short positions or sell.

To reduce risk, consider placing stop-loss orders above the recent high. You can also project the vertical distance between the neckline and the highest peak downward to determine profit targets.

Second, after the neckline breakout, prices sometimes retest the neckline from below before declining. As part of this strategy, you should watch for price breaks below the neckline, wait for price pullbacks to the neckline, and then look for bearish confirmation signals (such as bearish candlestick patterns, trendline breaks, or lower highs) to enter short positions.

Multiple techniques can be used to confirm profit targets, including projecting the pattern height downward or finding potential support levels. Stop-losses can be placed above recent highs.

Third, additional technical indicators or oscillators can be used to make double top patterns more reliable. For example, check for bearish divergence on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram or Relative Strength Index (RSI) when price forms two peaks. You can enter short positions when the neckline is broken and indicators confirm bearish signals, while following the above-mentioned stop-loss and profit target criteria.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Double Tops

The double top pattern is a visual signal indicating a potential trend reversal from bullish to bearish. This is beneficial for traders who wish to profit from market trajectory changes and capture new profit opportunities.

Furthermore, when two consecutive peaks occur at almost the same price level, they typically form a clear resistance level. Traders can use this level as a benchmark for setting stop-loss orders and profit targets, thereby improving risk management and trade planning.

In a double top pattern, the breakthrough of the neckline also presents a good entry point for traders to initiate short positions. If the price fails to break below the neckline, this provides a fixed level for market entry and helps determine where the pattern becomes invalid. The pattern's height can also be used to project profit targets, offering traders clear exit opportunities.

Volume analysis can provide greater confidence in confirming the pattern's validity. Volume typically increases when price breaks below the neckline, while volume decreases during the formation of the two peaks.

This increase in volume can further strengthen the pattern's signal. Therefore, in some ways, double tops can be more predictable and reliable than other strategies.

Finally, by identifying double top patterns, traders can determine their profit targets and potential downside objectives based on the pattern's height. Since potential profit targets are usually higher than the initial risk (stop-loss), this typically provides a favorable risk-reward ratio.

However, double top patterns are not foolproof. Like other chart patterns, they can sometimes generate false signals. Failed double top patterns can occur when price briefly forms two peaks before continuing upward. Therefore, neckline breakouts and other supporting signals should be used as confirmation, and traders should operate with caution.

There can be some subjectivity involved in identifying double top patterns. The position of peaks and troughs, as well as the pattern's symmetry, may be interpreted differently by traders. This subjectivity can lead to variations and different outcomes among traders.

Not all double top patterns have perfect symmetry or identical peaks and troughs. Price ranges, duration, and design shapes are flexible. Due to this variability, it can become difficult to precisely specify entry and exit positions or determine pattern target levels.

The downside target for double top patterns is typically calculated by projecting the pattern's height downward from the neckline. However, potential profit targets may be limited compared to the initial risk or stop-loss level. Depending on market conditions, price may not necessarily reach the projected target, potentially resulting in lower-than-expected profits.

#### Advantages

- Allows traders to trade based on visual patterns
- May indicate clear resistance levels
- May convey clear entry and exit points
- May be confirmed through volume

#### Disadvantages

- Like any chart pattern, may generate false signals
- May depend on subjective pattern recognition
- Different types of investments may produce slightly different variations
- May lead to limited profit potential

## Is a Double Top Pattern Bullish?

No, a double top pattern is not considered bullish. This chart pattern is bearish, indicating a potential change from an upward trend to a downward trend.

## What Does a Double Top Pattern Indicate?

A double top is a technical chart pattern that typically suggests a potential reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend. It forms when an asset's price reaches a resistance level twice and fails to break through, subsequently beginning to decline.

## Can Trading Double Top Patterns Be Profitable?

Double top patterns can be profitable when traded with proper evaluation, risk management, and under suitable market conditions. However, profitability is not guaranteed, and multiple factors can influence the outcome.

## What is the Success Rate of Double Top Patterns?

The success rate of any chart pattern depends on multiple factors.

Market conditions, time frames, the degree of pattern formation, and the presence of confirmation signals all affect the success rate.

It's important to remember that chart patterns (such as double tops) don't always accurately predict future price movements. They may generate false signals or failed patterns, but are still useful for identifying potential trends and reversals.

## Summary

Traders and analysts interpret the double top pattern as a bearish indicator. This suggests that the upward trend is slowing down, and there is a higher probability of price decline.

The breakthrough of the neckline, which is the horizontal line formed between the troughs, is typically used by traders to confirm this pattern. When the price breaks below the neckline, it is seen as a signal to initiate short positions or sell, with the expectation that prices will continue to fall.
