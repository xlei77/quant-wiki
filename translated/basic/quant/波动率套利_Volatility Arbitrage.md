## What is Volatility Arbitrage?

Volatility arbitrage is a trading strategy that aims to profit from the difference between the predicted future price volatility of an asset and the implied volatility derived from options based on that asset.

Volatility arbitrage comes with various risks, including the timing of holding positions, potential changes in asset prices, and uncertainties in implied volatility estimates.

### Key Points

- Volatility arbitrage is a trading strategy used to profit from the difference between the predicted future price volatility of an asset (such as stocks) and its option implied volatility.
- When considering trades, investors must determine whether implied volatility is overvalued or undervalued.
- If the underlying stock price moves faster than the investor's expectations, the strategy must be adjusted, which can be difficult and potentially expensive when market conditions permit.
- If traders believe stock options are undervalued due to low implied volatility, they might consider opening a long call option position while establishing a short position in the underlying stock to profit from their expectations.
- Hedge fund traders may study volatility arbitrage to conduct trades.

## How Volatility Arbitrage Works

Since option pricing is affected by the underlying asset's volatility, if the predicted volatility differs from the implied volatility, there will be a difference between the expected price of the option and its actual market price.

Volatility arbitrage strategies can be implemented by establishing a delta-neutral portfolio containing options and their underlying assets. For example, suppose a trader believes that a stock option is undervalued due to low implied volatility. In this case, they might take a long position in the call option while simultaneously holding a short position in the underlying stock to profit from this expectation. If the stock price remains unchanged and the trader's judgment about rising implied volatility is correct, the option's cost will increase.

If the trader believes the implied volatility is too high and will decrease, they might decide to take a long position in the stock while shorting the call option. Assuming the stock price remains unchanged, the trader could potentially profit as the implied volatility falls, because the option's value will decrease accordingly.

**Important Note:** Volatility arbitrage strategies are relatively complex and carry risks for traders, but can be implemented by establishing a delta-neutral portfolio containing options and their underlying assets.

## Special Considerations

Traders must make several assumptions, which increase the complexity of volatility arbitrage strategies.

First, investors must determine whether implied volatility is overvalued or undervalued. Second, investors must accurately judge the time needed for the strategy to become profitable, otherwise the decay in time value may exceed any potential gains.

Finally, if the underlying stock price moves faster than anticipated, the strategy needs to be adjusted, which can be very expensive or even impossible under market conditions.
