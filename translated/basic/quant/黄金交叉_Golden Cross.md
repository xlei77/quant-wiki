## What is a Golden Cross?

A golden cross is a chart pattern that occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average. It is a bullish breakout pattern that forms when a security's short-term moving average (for example, the 50-day moving average) crosses above its long-term moving average (for example, the 200-day moving average) or resistance level.

Since long-term indicators carry more weight, a golden cross suggests the potential beginning of a long-term bull market. Generally, higher trading volume reinforces the validity of this indicator.

### Key Points

- Golden Cross is a technical chart pattern that indicates potential significant upward momentum.
- A Golden Cross appears on a chart when a stock's short-term moving average crosses above its long-term moving average.
- The Golden Cross stands in contrast to the Death Cross, which signals bearish price movement.

## How Does a Golden Cross Form?

A golden cross is a momentum indicator, signifying sustained price increases that form momentum. This indicates that traders' and investors' sentiment has shifted to bullish. The indicator typically develops in three phases.

The first phase requires the downtrend to finally bottom out as buyers gain dominance. In the second phase, the shorter-term moving average crosses above the longer-term moving average, triggering a breakout and confirming the reversal of the downtrend.

**Note:** Support levels are price levels where the market refuses to go lower. Resistance levels are price levels where the market resists going higher. A breakout occurs when price breaks through either of these levels.

The final phase is the continuing uptrend after the crossover. The moving averages act as support levels during pullbacks until they cross back down.

When observing golden crosses, the most commonly used moving averages are the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Generally, longer-term averages tend to form stronger and more lasting breakouts. For example, in indices like the S&P 500, the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average is one of the most popular bullish market signals.

Day traders typically use shorter periods, such as 5-day and 15-day moving averages for intraday golden cross breakout trades. Some traders might use different period increments like weekly or monthly based on personal trading preferences and what they find effective.

However, when choosing different periods, it's important to understand that the larger the chart timeframe, the stronger and more lasting golden cross breakouts tend to be.

## Golden Cross Example

The chart below uses 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The 50-day moving average trends downward across multiple trading periods, eventually reaching a price level that the market cannot sustain. The 200-day moving average stabilizes after a slight decline.

As time progresses, prices gradually rise, forming an upward trend in the 50-day moving average. This trend continues, pushing the short-term moving average above the long-term moving average, creating a golden cross and confirming the reversal from a downward trend to an upward trend.

Note that when the downward trend bottoms out and turns upward, there is a significant jump in the price range of the candlesticks. At this point, something may have changed that altered the market sentiment among investors and traders.

The first bullish candle has a large real body (the difference between opening and closing prices), and during the first rebound after the 50-day moving average bottoms out, more trading days close at prices significantly higher than their opening prices.

## Golden Cross and Death Cross

The Golden Cross and Death Cross are opposing indicators. The Golden Cross confirms the emergence of a long-term bull market, while the Death Cross signals a long-term bear market. Any crossing is considered more significant when accompanied by high trading volume. In a Death Cross, the short-term moving average crosses the long-term moving average from above; in a Golden Cross, it crosses from below.

Once a crossing occurs, from this point forward, the long-term moving average is viewed as the market's primary support level (in the case of a Golden Cross) or resistance level (in the case of a Death Cross). Either type of cross may appear and signal a trend change, but they are more commonly observed at moments when the trend has already changed.

#### Golden Cross

- May indicate the start of a long-term bull market
- Short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average
- Long-term moving average becomes a support level

#### Death Cross

- May indicate the beginning of a long-term bear market
- Short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average
- Long-term moving average becomes resistance level

## Limitations of the Golden Cross

All indicators are "lagging," meaning the data used to form the charts has already occurred. This implies that no indicator can truly predict the future. Many observed golden crosses may generate false signals.

Although it seems to have some predictive power in forecasting previous major bull markets, golden crosses also frequently fail to materialize. Therefore, other signals and indicators should always be used to confirm a golden cross.

## Is the Golden Cross Always Bullish?

A Golden Cross occurs when a short-term moving average breaks above a major long-term moving average, which analysts and traders interpret as a clear upward signal in the market. This represents a bullish outlook from investors.

## What Does a Golden Cross Mean?

A golden cross suggests the beginning of a long-term bull market ahead. It is the opposite of a death cross, which is a bearish indicator that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average.

## How Reliable is the Golden Cross?

As a lagging indicator, the Golden Cross is only identified after market upturns, which makes it appear relatively reliable. However, due to its lagging nature, traders find it difficult to determine whether a signal is false before it proves to be so. Traders typically use the Golden Cross to confirm trends or signals in conjunction with other indicators.

## Summary

The golden cross is considered to confirm the reversal of a downward trend. The key to properly using the golden cross lies in combining additional filters and indicators, employing profit targets, stop losses, and other risk management tools. Remember to maintain a favorable risk-reward ratio and trade at reasonable times, rather than blindly following crossing signals.
