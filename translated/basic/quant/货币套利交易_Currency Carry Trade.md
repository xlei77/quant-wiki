## What is Currency Carry Trade?

Currency carry trade is a strategy where high-yielding currencies are traded against low-yielding currencies. Traders employing this strategy attempt to capture the interest rate differential, which can be quite substantial depending on the leverage used.

Carry trading is one of the most popular trading strategies in the forex market. The most popular carry trades involve buying currency pairs like AUD/JPY and NZD/JPY, as these pairs typically have relatively high interest rate differentials. The first step in carry trading is to identify which currencies offer high yields and which ones offer low yields.

## Basic Knowledge of Currency Carry Trade

Currency carry trade is one of the most popular trading strategies in the currency market and can be seen as an embodiment of the "buy low, sell high" concept. The best way to initially implement carry trades is to identify which currencies have higher yields and which have lower yields.

The most popular carry trades involve buying currency pairs such as AUD/JPY and NZD/JPY because these currency pairs have very high interest rate differentials.

Operationally, traders can profit from the interest rate differential between two currencies as long as the exchange rate between the two countries remains unchanged. Many professional traders use this trading method because, considering leverage effects, the returns can be very substantial. If a trader in our example uses common 10:1 leverage, they can earn 10 times the interest rate differential as profit.

The funding currency is the currency being exchanged in carry trades. Funding currencies typically have lower interest rates. Investors borrow and short the funding currency while establishing long positions in the target currency (which has higher interest rates). Central banks of funding currency countries, such as the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the U.S. Federal Reserve System, often implement aggressive monetary stimulus policies, resulting in lower interest rates. These banks use monetary policy to lower rates to promote growth during economic recessions. As rates fall, speculators borrow funds and hope to close positions before rates rise again.

The best time to enter carry trades is when central banks are raising interest rates (or considering rate hikes). Many traders enter the market, driving up the value of the currency pair. Similarly, these trades perform well during periods of low volatility because traders are willing to take on more risk. As long as the currency's value doesn't fall—even if it doesn't fluctuate significantly—traders can still earn returns.

However, during periods of falling interest rates, carry trades don't provide traders with substantial returns. This change in monetary policy implies changes in currency values. When interest rates fall, demand for that currency often decreases, making it difficult to sell the currency. Fundamentally, for carry trades to be profitable, there must either be no major fluctuations or the currency must appreciate.

### Key Points

- Currency carry trade is a strategy where high-yield currencies are funded by low-yield currencies.
- Traders employing this strategy attempt to capture the interest rate differential, which can be substantial depending on the level of leverage used.
- Carry trading is one of the most popular trading strategies in the forex market.

## Currency Arbitrage Trading Example

To illustrate a currency arbitrage trade, suppose a trader notices that the interest rate in Japan is 0.5%, while the U.S. interest rate is 4%. This means the trader expects to earn a 3.5% profit, which is the spread between the two rates. The first step is to borrow yen and convert it to dollars. The second step is to invest these dollars in securities that pay the U.S. interest rate. Assuming the current exchange rate is 115 yen per dollar, the trader borrows 50 million yen. Once converted, they will receive:

U.S. Dollars = 50 million yen ÷ 115 = $434,782.61

在按4%美国利率投资一年后，交易者的余额为：

期末余额 = $434,782.61 x 1.04 = $452,173.91

现在，交易者欠下5000万日元的本金加上0.5%的利息，总计：

应付金额 = 5000万日元 x 1.005 = 5025万日元

如果汇率在一年内保持不变，并最终维持在115，美元应付金额为：

应付金额 = 5025万日元 ÷ 115 = $436,956.52

The trader profits from the difference between the final dollar balance and the amount payable, with a profit of:

Profit = $452,173.91 - $436,956.52 = $15,217.39

请注意，这一利润正是预期的金额：$15,217.39 ÷ $434,782.62 = 3.5%

If the exchange rate moves unfavorably against the yen, the trader will profit more. If the yen appreciates, the trader's return will be less than 3.5% and might even result in a loss.

## Risks and Limitations of Arbitrage Trading

In arbitrage trading, the main risk is exchange rate uncertainty. Using the above example, if the US dollar depreciates against the Japanese yen, traders may suffer losses. Moreover, these trades typically employ significant leverage, so small fluctuations in exchange rates can lead to substantial losses unless the position is appropriately hedged.

Effective arbitrage trading strategies involve more than simply going long on the highest-yielding currency and short on the lowest-yielding currency. While current interest rate levels are important, future interest rate trends are even more crucial. For example, if the US Federal Reserve begins raising rates when the Reserve Bank of Australia has finished its rate hike cycle, the US dollar may appreciate against the Australian dollar.

Furthermore, arbitrage trading is only effective when market sentiment is stable or optimistic. Uncertainty, worry, and fear can cause investors to close their arbitrage positions. The 45% sell-off in currency pairs such as AUD/JPY and NZD/JPY in 2008 was triggered when the subprime crisis evolved into a global financial crisis. Since arbitrage trades typically involve leverage, actual losses can be even greater.
