## What is a News Trader?

A news trader refers to a trader or investor who makes decisions based on news announcements. Breaking news, economic reports, and coverage of other events can have temporary effects on the price movements of stocks, bonds, and other securities. News traders seek to profit by capitalizing on market sentiment before major news releases and by trading on market reactions after news announcements.

### Key Points

- News traders utilize scheduled announcements to trade, aiming to profit from short-term volatility.
- News traders can also trade significant unplanned events that affect domestic or global economies.
- News traders typically hold positions for very brief periods, as the impact of news tends to diminish rapidly after release.

## Understanding News Traders

The adage "buy the rumor, sell the news" recognizes that rumors have one type of effect on security prices, while news can have the opposite effect. Therefore, news traders focus on trading in the short periods before or after news releases, when markets are still reacting to the news. These periods are typically characterized by higher volatility, creating opportunities for profit.

News traders primarily attempt to profit from either the timing or potential content of scheduled news announcements. When news is scheduled, such as earnings reports or Federal Reserve meetings, news trading becomes more of a bet on the potential impact of the announcement's significance. In fact, the Federal Reserve tries to minimize the market impact of its statements by telegraphing each major policy decision well in advance, but even these policy signals have become tradeable events.

When news surprises everyone, such as natural disasters or black swan events, news traders try to position themselves for profit. Sometimes this means capitalizing on volatility, or making judgments about the immediate directional impact of news on current price trends.

**Note:** In most cases, news traders are day traders, as they typically open and close positions within the same trading day.

## Tools and Strategies for News Traders

News traders utilize various strategies and focus on market psychology and historical data. Traders may examine historical data, such as past earnings reports, to predict how upcoming news (like forthcoming earnings reports) might affect prices. By becoming familiar with specific markets, news traders can make informed predictions about whether a security's price will rise or fall after news releases.

News traders can also set up queries and alerts to gather breaking news and correlate it with price changes on charts. If certain conditions are met, news traders will enter bullish or bearish positions according to their trading strategy. Since news is time-sensitive and typically affects short-term movements, profit opportunities only exist while the news is fresh.

A common strategy used by news traders is known as "counter-trading," which involves trading against the trend when market enthusiasm wanes. For example, a stock might open significantly higher in pre-market trading due to positive earnings announcements. News traders might observe this optimism reach its peak and subsequently short the stock intraday. Although the stock may still be up significantly compared to the previous day, traders may have profited from the day's high-low spread.
