## What is Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)?

Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a large hedge fund led by Nobel Prize winners and prominent Wall Street traders that collapsed in 1998, forcing the U.S. government to intervene to prevent a financial market meltdown.

### Key Points

- Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) was a large hedge fund led by Nobel Prize-winning economists and prominent Wall Street traders.
- At its peak, LTCM was highly profitable and had attracted approximately $3.5 billion in investor capital by spring 1998, promising investors substantial returns through its arbitrage strategies.
- LTCM's highly leveraged trading strategies failed to work, with losses amplified by the Russian debt default, forcing the U.S. government to intervene to prevent global financial contagion.
- Eventually, a consortium of Wall Street banks formed a bailout fund in September 1998 to rescue LTCM, allowing for its orderly liquidation.

## Understanding Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)

Since its establishment in 1994, LTCM achieved tremendous success, attracting approximately $3.5 billion in investor capital by spring 1998, promising arbitrage strategies that could capitalize on short-term market behavior changes and theoretically reduce risk to zero.

However, LTCM's highly leveraged trading strategy failed to deliver, resulting in massive losses. This impact spread throughout the financial sector, nearly triggering a global financial system collapse in 1998. Eventually, the U.S. government had to intervene, orchestrating a bailout through a consortium of Wall Street banks to prevent systemic contagion.

LTCM started with initial assets of one billion dollars, focusing on bond trading. The fund's trading strategy involved convergence trades, taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities between securities. Success depended on these securities being mispriced relative to each other at the time of trading.

For example, one arbitrage trading scenario involved interest rate changes that were not yet fully reflected in securities prices. This created opportunities to trade these securities at values different from their impending new prices.

**Note:** LTCM was founded in 1994 by John Meriwether, the renowned Salomon Brothers bond trader, together with Nobel laureate Myron Scholes, co-creator of the Black-Scholes model.

LTCM also participated in interest rate swaps, contracts where two parties exchange a series of future interest payments based on a specific principal amount. Interest rate swaps typically involve exchanging fixed rates for floating rates, or vice versa, to minimize exposure to overall interest rate fluctuations.

Due to the small yield differences in arbitrage opportunities, LTCM had to be highly leveraged to generate profits. At its peak in 1998, LTCM had approximately $5 billion in assets, controlled over $100 billion, and held derivative positions worth more than $1 trillion. At that time, LTCM had also borrowed more than $155 billion in assets.

## The Collapse of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)

In August 1998, Russia defaulted on its debt, and LTCM was holding large positions in Russian government bonds (known as GKO). Despite losing hundreds of millions of dollars daily, LTCM's computer models continued to recommend maintaining these positions.

LTCM's highly leveraged nature, combined with the Russian financial crisis, led to massive losses for the hedge fund, putting it at risk of defaulting on its own loans. This made it difficult for LTCM to unwind its positions. LTCM's total positions accounted for approximately 5% of the global fixed-income market, and the fund had borrowed enormous sums to finance these leveraged trades.

**Important:** If LTCM were to default, it could trigger a global financial crisis, as its creditors would be forced to take massive write-downs on their assets.

When losses approached $4 billion, the U.S. Federal Government, concerned that LTCM's imminent collapse would trigger a broader financial crisis, orchestrated a bailout to calm the markets. A $3.625 billion loan fund was established, allowing LTCM to survive the market turbulence and liquidate in an orderly manner by early 2000.
