## What is Mean Reversion?

The concept of mean reversion is widely applied in various financial time series data, including prices, returns, and book values. When an asset's current market price is below its historical average price, it is typically considered attractive for purchase. Conversely, if the current price is above the average level, it is expected to decline. Traders and investors adjust the timing of their trading and investment strategies through mean reversion.

### Key Points

- In finance, mean reversion implies that various related phenomena such as asset prices and return volatility will eventually revert to their long-term average levels.
- Mean reversion theory has given rise to numerous investment strategies, from stock trading techniques to options pricing models.
- Mean reversion trading attempts to capitalize on extreme price movements of a particular security, assuming it will return to its previous state.
- Mean reversion tools in technical analysis include moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and stochastic oscillators.

## Understanding Mean Reversion

Mean reversion is a financial theory suggesting that asset prices eventually return to their long-term mean or average level. This concept is based on the belief that asset prices and historical returns tend to converge toward their long-term average over time. The greater the deviation from the mean, the higher the probability that the asset price will revert to the mean in the future.

This theory has led to various investment strategies involving buying or selling stocks or other securities that show significant deviation from their historical average performance. However, changes in returns may also indicate that a company's prospects are not what they once were, making mean reversion less likely to occur.

In mean reversion, beyond percentage returns and prices, interest rates and even a company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio may be subject to this phenomenon.

Investors use mean reversion strategies to profit from asset prices that significantly deviate from their historical average. The fundamental assumption is that prices will eventually return to their long-term average level. Investors typically use mean reversion in the following ways:

- **Statistical Analysis**: Investors use statistical tools like Z-scores to measure how far asset prices have deviated from the mean. When Z-scores are above 1.5 or below -1.5, this may indicate trading opportunities.
- **Pairs Trading**: Here, investors and traders identify two correlated assets. When the price ratio between them deviates from the mean, they go long the undervalued asset and short the overvalued one.
- **Volatility**: Some traders and investors use mean reversion in the context of volatility, buying options when volatility is high, expecting it to eventually revert to the mean.
- **Risk Management**: Stop-loss orders and profit targets can often be set around the mean to manage potential losses and secure gains.
- **Algorithmic Trading**: Quantitative analysts use mean reversion in algorithmic trading strategies, often employing sophisticated mathematical models to predict price movements.

Considerations in mean reversion include time horizons and market conditions. The effectiveness of mean reversion strategies may vary depending on the time horizon. Short-term traders might use intraday data, while long-term investors might use annual data.

Another consideration is that mean reversion strategies work better in range-bound markets and perform poorly in trending markets.

## Calculating Mean Reversion

Calculating mean reversion involves a series of statistical and quantitative steps to measure how much an asset's price deviates from its historical mean.

First, collect historical price data for the relevant asset. The time range can vary depending on the investor's or trader's time horizon. Then, calculate the average price over the selected time period.

$$ Mean = Prices之和 / 观察数量 $$

Next, calculate the deviation for each price point.

$$ Deviation = Price - Mean $$

Then, calculate the standard deviation of the price series to understand volatility.

$$ Standard Deviation = Square Root (Squared Deviations之和 / (观察数量 - 1)) $$

Using this data, calculate the Z-score. The Z-score measures how many standard deviations an element is from the mean.

$$ Z-Score = Deviation / Standard Deviation $$

A Z-score above a certain threshold (typically 1.5 or 2) may indicate that the asset is overvalued, while a score below another threshold (typically -1.5 or -2) may indicate that the asset is undervalued.

## Mean Reversion and Technical Analysis

Mean reversion is an important concept in technical analysis, serving as a fundamental principle for various indicators and trading strategies. It helps traders identify overbought or oversold conditions, thereby providing potential entry and exit points. Here are some technical indicator tools involving the concept of mean reversion:

- **Moving Averages**: Traders and investors commonly use moving averages to identify the mean price over a specific period. When the price is above the moving average and exceeds a certain threshold, it may be considered overbought. Conversely, when the price is below the moving average and falls below a certain threshold, it may be considered oversold.
- **Bollinger Bands**: The Bollinger Bands technical indicator consists of a middle band (simple moving average) and two outer bands calculated using standard deviation. Prices are expected to revert to the middle band.
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: RSI ranges from 0 to 100 and is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. An RSI above 70 indicates an overbought condition, while below 30 indicates an oversold condition, both suggesting possible mean reversion.
- **Stochastic Oscillator**: This indicator compares a security's closing price to its price range over a specific period, typically 14 days. Stochastic oscillator values above 80 are considered overbought, while values below 20 are considered oversold.
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: MACD is used to identify changes in trend strength, direction, momentum, and duration. When MACD crosses its signal line, it may indicate that the asset is deviating from its mean.

Day trading involves buying and selling financial instruments within the same trading day, typically holding positions for just minutes or hours. Mean reversion plays a crucial role in day trading strategies as it helps traders profit from short-term price fluctuations.

Key strategies include intraday moving average methods. Day traders typically use short-term moving averages to identify intraday mean prices. When asset prices deviate significantly, reversion is expected.

Additionally, day traders use RSI and stochastic oscillators to identify overbought or oversold conditions on an intraday basis. Signals from these technical analysis tools often prompt day traders to enter or exit positions. Moreover, in Bollinger Bands trading, day traders look for "squeezes," where the bandwidth narrows, indicating low volatility and potential significant price movement, with reversion expected to the mean or middle band.

In fact, some day traders use algorithmic strategies based on mean reversion algorithms for high-frequency trading.

Swing trading is a trading style with positions held for several days to weeks, aiming to profit from short to medium-term price movements. Mean reversion is a key concept in swing trading, helping traders identify potential reversals in price trends.

**Tip**: For moving averages, swing traders typically use longer moving average periods than day traders to identify mean prices over specific periods.

Price crosses above or below moving averages, followed by significant deviation, may indicate potential reversals. Additionally, tools like RSI and MACD are used to identify overbought or oversold conditions, suggesting possible mean reversion. Furthermore, Fibonacci retracements are used to identify potential levels where prices might revert to the mean, with the most common retracement levels being 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%.

Finally, swing traders also use candlestick patterns such as doji, hammer, bullish engulfing, and bearish engulfing patterns to identify potential reversals, including mean reversion opportunities.

In forex trading, mean reversion strategies aim to capitalize on currency pairs reverting to their historical mean or average price. Mean reversion is particularly useful when using technical analysis indicators to identify short-term opportunities.

Forex traders typically use moving averages to identify mean exchange rates over specific periods. When currency pairs deviate significantly from this average, reversion is typically expected.

Indicators such as RSI and stochastic oscillators are commonly used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in currency pairs, suggesting possible mean reversion.

Forex traders and investors also use pivots, tools used to identify potential support and resistance levels where prices might revert to the mean. Pivots are calculated based on the previous trading session's high, low, and closing prices.

Finally, currency correlation is another tool. Some traders and investors use mean reversion in the context of currency correlations. When two historically correlated currency pairs diverge, traders might go long the underperforming pair and short the outperforming pair.

## Mean Reversion Hypothesis Example

Consider a mean reversion scenario involving Company XYZ.

Over the past 200 days, XYZ's stock had an average closing price of 50. Due to a positive earnings report, the stock price jumped to 70.

The standard deviation of the stock price over the past 200 days was 5.

Next, calculate the Z-score, (70-50)/5 = 4.

A Z-score of 4 indicates that the stock is significantly overvalued relative to its historical mean. This could be a signal to short the stock, as it is expected to revert to the mean.

Over the following weeks, the initial excitement gradually fades, and the stock price gradually falls back to around 52, close to its historical mean.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Mean Reversion

Mean reversion provides a structured and flexible trading approach, but it comes with its own challenges, including sensitivity to market conditions and higher transaction costs. Therefore, traders and investors must be aware of these factors and employ effective risk management techniques.

Mean reversion has several advantages, including:

- **Systematic Approach**: Mean reversion provides a structured methodology that makes it easier to identify entry and exit points.
- **Flexibility**: Can be applied to multiple asset classes and time frames, from intraday trading to long-term investment.
- **Risk Management**: Fixed stop-loss and profit levels can be set above and below the mean, helping to control risk.
- **Profit Potential**: Mean reversion strategies may be profitable in range-bound markets where other trend-following strategies might be less effective.
- **Confirmation**: Multiple indicators mentioned above can be used to confirm mean reversion signals, thereby improving strategy reliability.

**Important**: Mean reversion theory focuses on the regression of relatively extreme changes, while normal growth or other fluctuations are considered part of the expected range.

Of course, any method comes with challenges and limitations. Some limitations of mean reversion include:

- **Market Conditions**: Mean reversion performs poorly in strong trending markets, as prices may not revert to the mean for extended periods.
- **Transaction Costs**: The strategy typically involves frequent trading, which can result in higher transaction costs.
- **False Signals**: Short time frames are particularly susceptible to market noise, which can generate false mean reversion signals.
- **Economic Events**: Economic shocks or sudden news can disrupt mean reversion patterns, leading to potential losses.
- **Lack of Direction**: Unlike trend-following strategies, mean reversion is non-directional and may not suit all trading styles.

## What is Mean Reversion Strategy?

Mean reversion strategy is a trading method that capitalizes on the tendency of financial assets to revert to their historical mean or average price. This strategy aims to identify assets that are significantly overvalued or undervalued and trade based on the expectation that prices will return to their mean.

## What is the Optimal Time Frame for Mean Reversion?

The time frame for mean reversion depends on the trader or investor's objectives, risk tolerance, and the type of assets being traded.

## Which Assets are Most Suitable for Mean Reversion Trading?

The selection of assets for mean reversion trading strategies depends on multiple factors, such as market conditions, the entity's trading and investment expertise, and risk tolerance.

Some common trading assets suitable for mean reversion strategies include stocks, foreign exchange, commodities, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and fixed-income instruments.

## What's the difference between trend following and mean reversion?

Trend following and mean reversion operate on different premises. Trend following aims to capitalize on an asset's strong movement in a particular direction. Mean reversion aims to capture opportunities when prices deviate from an established mean or average value.

## Summary

Mean reversion is a financial theory suggesting that asset prices tend to revert to their historical mean or average over time. This theory serves as the cornerstone for various trading strategies across multiple asset classes, including stocks, forex, and commodities. Investors typically use indicators such as moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands to identify mean reversion opportunities. These indicators help identify overvalued or undervalued assets, thereby providing potential entry and exit points.

The strategy can be applied across different time frames, from intraday to long-term, and is particularly effective in range-bound or sideways markets. However, traders and investors must incorporate sound risk management techniques and pay attention to trading costs when implementing mean reversion strategies, given their frequent trading nature.
