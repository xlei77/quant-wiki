## What is Alpha?

Alpha (Î±) is an investment term that describes the ability or "edge" of an investment strategy to outperform the market. Therefore, alpha is often referred to as excess return or abnormal rate of return relative to a benchmark, compared after risk adjustment.

Alpha is typically used in conjunction with Beta, which measures the overall volatility or risk of the broader market, commonly known as systematic market risk.

In finance, alpha is viewed as a performance measure that indicates whether a strategy, trader, or portfolio manager can beat market returns or other benchmarks over a period of time. Alpha is generally considered the active return on investment, evaluating how an investment performs relative to a market index or benchmark that is considered representative of overall market movements.

The excess return of an investment relative to its benchmark index is its alpha. Alpha can be positive or negative and is the result of active investment. Beta, on the other hand, can be obtained through passive index investing.

### Key Points

- Alpha refers to the excess return obtained after adjusting for risk.
- Active portfolio managers seek to generate alpha in diversified portfolios, aiming to eliminate non-systematic risk.
- Alpha represents the portfolio's performance relative to its benchmark, and is therefore often viewed as the portfolio manager's value added or subtracted from fund returns.
- Jensen's alpha takes into account the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and includes a risk-adjusted component in its calculation.

## Understanding Alpha

Alpha is one of the five common technical investment risk ratios, with the other four being Beta, Standard Deviation, R-squared, and Sharpe ratio. These are statistical measures used in Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to help investors determine the risk-return characteristics of investments.

Active portfolio managers aim to generate alpha in diversified portfolios with the goal of eliminating unsystematic risk. Alpha represents the portfolio's performance relative to its benchmark, and is therefore often viewed as the portfolio manager's value addition or subtraction to the fund's returns.

In other words, alpha is the portion of investment returns that is not influenced by overall market movements. Thus, an alpha of zero means that the portfolio or fund perfectly tracks its benchmark index, and the manager has neither added nor subtracted additional value.

## Alpha's Application in Investment

With the rise of smart beta index funds, the concept of alpha has received increasing attention. These funds are associated with indices such as the S&P 500 and the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index. These funds attempt to enhance the performance of portfolios that track specific market subsets.

Although alpha cannot be ignored in portfolio management, many index benchmarks still outperform asset managers in the vast majority of cases. This is partly due to a trend of losing confidence in traditional financial advisors, with more investors turning to low-cost passive online advisors (commonly known as robo-advisors) who invest their clients' assets almost or entirely in index tracking funds, believing that if they cannot beat the market, they might as well move with it.

Furthermore, since most traditional financial advisors charge fees, when a manager manages a portfolio and achieves zero alpha, this actually represents a slight net loss for the investor. For example, suppose a financial advisor named Jim charges a fee of 1% of the portfolio value, and over a 12-month period, Jim generates an alpha of 0.75 for his client Frank's portfolio.

Although Jim did improve Frank's portfolio performance, his fees exceeded the alpha he created, resulting in a net loss for Frank's portfolio. This example highlights the importance of fees when considering performance returns and alpha.

## Efficient Market Hypothesis

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) assumes that market prices instantly absorb all available information, therefore securities are always rationally priced (the market is efficient). According to EMH, it is impossible to systematically identify and exploit mispricing in the market, because such mispricing simply does not exist.

If mispricing is discovered, the market will quickly correct it through arbitrage. Therefore, exploitable patterns of market anomalies that persist are typically rare.

Empirical analysis of historical active mutual fund returns against their passive benchmarks shows that less than 10% of active funds achieve positive alpha over a 10-year period, and this percentage decreases further after considering taxes and fees. In other words, alpha is not easy to obtain, especially after taxes and fees.

Since beta risk can be isolated through diversification and hedging different risks (which comes with various transaction costs), some argue that alpha doesn't actually exist but is rather compensation for certain unhedged or overlooked risks.

## Pursuing Investment Alpha

Alpha is commonly used to rank active mutual funds and other types of investments, typically expressed as a single number (such as +3.0 or -5.0), usually indicating how a portfolio or fund performs relative to a reference benchmark index (i.e., the percentage by which it outperforms or underperforms the benchmark).

A deeper analysis of alpha may also include Jensen's alpha. Jensen's alpha takes into account the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) market theory and incorporates a risk-adjusted component in its calculation. Beta (or beta coefficient) is used in CAPM, which calculates expected returns based on an asset's specific beta and expected market returns. Investment managers use both alpha and beta to calculate, compare, and analyze returns.

The entire investment landscape offers a wide range of securities, investment products, and advisory options for investors to consider. Different market cycles also affect the alpha of investments across different asset classes. Therefore, risk-return metrics become particularly important when considering alpha.

## Alpha Examples

Alpha is demonstrated in the following historical examples of two fixed-income ETFs and an equity ETF:

The iShares Convertible Bond ETF (ICVT) is a low-risk fixed-income investment. It tracks a custom index called the "Bloomberg US Convertible Cash Pay Bonds > 250MM Index." As of February 28, 2022, its three-year standard deviation was 18.94%. As of the same date, its year-to-date return was -6.67%. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg US Convertible Cash Pay Bonds > 250MM Index returned -13.7% during the same period. Therefore, ICVT's alpha compared to the Bloomberg US Aggregate Index was 6.5%, with a three-year standard deviation of 18.97%.

However, since the aggregate bond index is not an appropriate benchmark for ICVT (the correct benchmark should be the Bloomberg Convertible Bond Index), the magnitude of this alpha may be overstated; in fact, it might be misattributed due to convertible bonds having much higher risk characteristics than regular bonds.

The WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW) is a higher-risk equity investment designed to invest in dividend growth stocks. Its holdings track a custom index called the "WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Index." As of February 28, 2022, DGRW's annualized return was 18.1%, also higher than the S&P 500's 16.4%, resulting in an alpha of 1.7% compared to the S&P 500. However, again, the S&P 500 may not be the correct benchmark for this ETF, as dividend-paying growth stocks are a specific subset of the overall stock market and don't necessarily include America's 500 most valuable companies.

## Alpha Considerations

Although alpha is referred to as the "Holy Grail" of investing and thus receives widespread attention from investors and advisors, several important factors should be considered when using alpha.

When using generated alpha calculations, it is important to understand the related calculations. Alpha can be calculated using various benchmark indices within an asset class. In some cases, there may not be suitable pre-existing benchmarks, in which case advisors may use algorithms and other models to simulate benchmarks for the purpose of comparing alpha calculations.

Alpha can also refer to the abnormal return of a security or portfolio that exceeds the return predicted by equilibrium models such as CAPM. In this case, CAPM may aim to estimate investor returns at different points along the efficient frontier. If a portfolio's actual return is 15% while CAPM estimates that the portfolio should return 10%, then the portfolio's alpha is 5.0, meaning it generated a 5% return above what CAPM predicted.

## Alpha and Beta in Finance

Alpha measures the excess return of an investment relative to its benchmark, while beta is a measure of volatility, or risk. Active investors seek to achieve alpha returns through unique strategies.

## What Makes a Good Alpha in Finance?

In finance, particularly in trading and investing, what constitutes a good alpha varies depending on the investor's objectives and risk tolerance. Generally, a good alpha is one that remains positive after risk adjustment.

## What Does Negative Alpha Mean in Stocks?

Negative alpha in stocks means that the stock underperforms its benchmark after accounting for risk. If an investor aims to match or exceed a specific benchmark, but their portfolio performs below that benchmark, they have a negative alpha.

## Conclusion

Investors aim to achieve the highest possible returns. Alpha is a measure of risk-adjusted investment performance relative to a benchmark. Active investors seek returns above the benchmark through various strategies. Many funds, such as hedge funds, aim to generate alpha and charge higher management fees as a result.
