## What is a Short Squeeze?

A short squeeze refers to a situation in financial markets where a rapid increase in an asset's price forces short sellers to close their positions to limit losses. This phenomenon typically occurs when there are many short sellers of a security, indicating that numerous investors are betting on its price to fall.

A short squeeze usually begins when an asset's price unexpectedly surges. As many short sellers decide to cut their losses and exit their positions, the momentum of the short squeeze intensifies.

### Key Points

- A short squeeze occurs when many investors bet on a stock's decline, but its price instead rises sharply in the opposite direction.
- The short squeeze accelerates the stock's price increase as short sellers rush to close their positions to minimize losses.
- Contrarian investors try to predict short squeezes and buy stocks that show strong short-selling interest.
- Both short sellers and contrarian investors are engaging in risky operations. Prudent investors usually have additional and sufficient reasons when shorting or buying such stocks.

## How Does a Short Squeeze Work?

Short sellers trade with the expectation that a stock's price will fall. When a heavily shorted stock unexpectedly rises, short sellers may need to act quickly to limit their losses.

Short sellers borrow assets they believe will decline in price, intending to buy them back after the price falls. If their judgment is correct, they return the stock and profit from the difference between the initial short sale price and the buyback price. If wrong, they must buy at a higher price and pay the difference between their target price and selling price.

Since short sellers close their positions by buying, this buying action drives prices even higher. Continuous rapid price increases also attract buyers' attention to the security. The combination of new buyers and panicking short sellers creates a scenario of rapid price increases that are often remarkable and unprecedented.

**Note:** The term "short squeeze" comes from short sellers being forced to exit their positions at a loss.

Stocks targeted by short sellers are usually viewed by them as overvalued by the market. For example, Tesla (TSLA) won many investors' enthusiasm with its innovative electric vehicle production and marketing approach. While investors bet heavily on its potential, short sellers bet on its failure. In early 2020, Tesla became the most shorted stock on U.S. exchanges, with over 18% of its market value in short positions.[1]

From late 2019 to early 2020, Tesla's stock price soared 400%. Short sellers suffered heavy losses, accumulating approximately $8 billion in losses.[1] Although most stocks, including Tesla, fell in early March 2020 due to market decline, the stock eventually rebounded, causing Tesla's short sellers to lose over $40 billion total in 2020.[2]

## Why Short Squeezes Happen

Short sellers establish positions against stocks they believe won't decline. However, despite their reasonable rationale, positive news coverage, product launches, or better-than-expected earnings reports can reverse the situation.

The reversal in stock price might be temporary. But if not, as expiration dates approach, short sellers may face runaway losses. They typically choose to close positions immediately, even if it means taking substantial losses.

This is precisely how a short squeeze manifests. Each buy transaction from short sellers drives the price higher, forcing other short sellers to buy as well.

Two effective indicators for identifying stocks that might experience a short squeeze are short interest and the short interest ratio.

Short interest is the percentage of shorted shares relative to the total float. The short interest ratio is the number of shorted shares divided by the stock's average daily trading volume. Speculative stocks tend to have higher short interest than more stable companies.

Monitoring short interest can help determine if investor sentiment toward a company has changed. For example, if a stock's short interest typically ranges between 15% and 30%, breaking out of this range might indicate a shift in investors' view of the company. Declining short interest might suggest the stock price has risen too quickly, or short sellers are exiting because the price has become too stable.

Rising short interest above normal levels indicates more pessimistic investor sentiment. However, extremely high readings might signal an impending short squeeze, which could drive prices even higher.

Contrarian investors might buy heavily shorted stocks to capitalize on potential short squeezes. While rapid price increases are attractive, this isn't without risk. The stock might be heavily shorted for good reasons, such as poor prospects.

Active traders monitor heavily shorted stocks, waiting for them to begin rebounding. Once prices start rising, they buy quickly, trying to capture potential short squeezes and significant upside moves.

Many stocks rise after experiencing heavy short selling, but there are also plenty of heavily shorted stocks that continue to decline.

High short interest doesn't guarantee price increases. It indicates many believe it will fall. Any buyer hoping to profit from a short squeeze should have additional (and more substantial) reasons to believe the stock price will rise.

## Difference Between Naked Short Selling and Short Squeeze

Naked short selling refers to short selling without first borrowing the underlying asset. It is a practice of selling short-term shares that have not been confirmed to exist. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), abusive naked short selling is illegal. [3]

Nevertheless, naked short selling still exists due to differences between electronic trading and paper trading. Naked short selling can intensify a short squeeze because it allows for additional short selling. Naked short selling is considered to help balance the market, meaning it can force prices down, leading to some stock sales to minimize losses, thereby allowing the market to effectively find equilibrium.

## Short Squeeze Examples

Let's consider a hypothetical biotech company XYZ, whose drug candidate is undergoing advanced clinical trials.

There is considerable skepticism among investors about whether the drug is actually effective. As a result, there is significant short interest. In fact, out of XYZ's 25 million floating shares, 5 million shares are sold short. This means XYZ has a short interest of 20%, and with an average daily trading volume of 1 million shares, its short interest ratio is 5. This short interest ratio is also known as "days to cover," meaning it would take short sellers 5 days to buy back all their shorted XYZ shares.

Suppose that due to the massive short interest, XYZ's stock price fell from $15 to $5 several months ago. Subsequently, news emerged that XYZ's drug was performing better than expected. XYZ's stock price jumped to $9, with speculators buying the stock while short sellers rushed to cover their positions.

Every short seller who sold short between $9 and $5 is now in a losing position. Those who shorted near $5 face the largest losses, as they frantically search for an exit with their investment already down 80%.

The stock opens at $9 but continues to rise over the next few days as short sellers keep covering their positions, and the rising price and positive news attract new buyers.

## Real-World Case: The GameStop Short Squeeze

In the months following the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant short squeeze occurred between GameStop Corporation (GME) traders and investors. Due to consumers being locked down and stores closed, analysts and investors predicted the company might face bankruptcy due to increased competition and declining foot traffic in physical stores, making GME a prime target for short sellers. Short interest grew so rapidly that over 100% of its total shares were sold short.[4]

This prompted Michael Burry of Scion Asset Management to prepare for a long-term optimistic outlook for the company: he believed the company could return to profitability within a few years rather than go bankrupt. His theory was spread and cited by Reddit and YouTube content creators in mid-2020. Michael Burry and Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen also took long positions.[5]

As more investors began buying the stock in late 2020, the share price started rising significantly. Subsequently, retail investors' buying and call options created a snowball effect. The price surge forced some short sellers to exit and attracted many prominent investors and public figures, such as Elon Musk and venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya.[5]

Due to the short squeeze against major hedge funds, GameStop's stock price soared from less than $5 to $120 per share in just one month.[6]

After the initial "meme stock" frenzy, GameStop's stock continued to decline, settling at just over $10 per share by spring 2024. However, in mid-May of that year, the stock suddenly surged again after Keith Gill, known as "Roaring Kitty," resurfaced on social media.

Gill's mysterious posts on X (formerly Twitter) reignited interest in GameStop and other meme stocks, leading to significant spikes in trading volume and prices. On May 14, 2024, GameStop's stock rose nearly 100%, following a 74% increase the previous day.[7] This sudden rebound surprised many investors and analysts, as the company's fundamentals hadn't significantly improved since the first meme stock frenzy in 2021.

The 2024 meme stock revival again put pressure on short sellers who had rebuilt short positions against GME and other meme companies. According to data from analytics firm S3 Partners, GameStop's short sellers lost over $1.3 billion in the initial squeeze in May 2024, with potential for further losses if the stock continued to rise.[8]

While the 2024 meme stock revival shared many similarities with the 2021 events, some analysts questioned whether this phenomenon would have the same long-term impact on market and retail investor participation. Nevertheless, the sudden revival of these stocks served as another reminder of the power of social media and retail investor sentiment in driving market trends.[7]

## What is Days to Cover? Is it useful for identifying short squeeze targets?

Days to Cover, also known as the short interest ratio, is calculated by dividing the total number of shares sold short by the average daily trading volume of the stock. For example, if a stock has 1 million shares sold short and its average daily trading volume is 100,000 shares, then the Days to Cover is 10 days. In other words, based on the average daily trading volume, short sellers would need 10 days to close their positions.

Generally speaking, the higher a stock's Days to Cover, the more likely it is to experience a short squeeze. If Stock A and Stock B have Days to Cover of 2 days and 20 days respectively, then Stock B may be more vulnerable as a short squeeze target.

## Who Loses and Who Benefits in a Short Squeeze?

During a short squeeze on a stock, speculators and traders holding short positions in that stock face massive losses. Meanwhile, contrarian investors who established long positions in anticipation of the short squeeze benefit as they profit from the rising stock price.

## Where Can I Find Information About Stocks with High Short Interest?

Financial portals like Yahoo Finance offer free stock screening tools that can generate lists of heavily shorted stocks; drilling down into individual stocks reveals relevant short-selling information, such as the number of shares sold short and short interest ratios for specific companies. Online resources like MarketBeat provide useful short-selling data, including largest short positions, how these positions change over time, and short interest ratios. Exchanges like the NYSE and NASDAQ also publish short interest data across their entire exchanges.

## What is the biggest short squeeze in history?

During the 2008 financial crisis, Porsche Automobil Holding SE (POAHY), as the major shareholder of Volkswagen AG (VWAGY), further increased its stake in Volkswagen to approximately 75%. Lower Saxony also held over 20% of the company's shares, leaving very few remaining tradable shares when the stock was heavily shorted.[9] As a result, hedge funds and other short sellers suddenly found themselves in a predicament, as Porsche's move meant that not all short sellers would be able to close their positions. Against this backdrop, short sellers were forced to buy back the shares they had sold, driving Volkswagen's stock price up to 999 euros.[10]

## Summary

A short squeeze can occur suddenly, with prices climbing in a parabolic fashion. However, typically, a short squeeze is triggered by unusually high short interest in the relevant security. When certain conditions cause the stock price to rise, short sellers simultaneously rush to the exit, attempting to buy to cover their positions. This provides momentum for driving the stock price higher, followed by an irrational state. The price action in GameStop stock in 2021 perfectly demonstrated the actual process of how a short squeeze operates.
