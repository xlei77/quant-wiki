## What is the Relative Strength Index (RSI)?

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes in a security to evaluate whether the security's price is overbought or oversold.

RSI is presented as an oscillator (a line graph) that moves between 0 and 100. The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and was first introduced in his groundbreaking 1978 book "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems."

RSI not only identifies overbought and oversold securities but also indicates securities that may be ready for a trend reversal or price correction. It can serve as a signal for buying and selling. Typically, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition, while a reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition.

### Key Points

- Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a popular momentum oscillator indicator introduced in 1978.
- RSI provides technical traders with signals about bullish and bearish price momentum, typically plotted below an asset's price chart.
- An asset is generally considered overbought when RSI exceeds 70 and oversold when it falls below 30.
- Traders often view RSI line crossings of overbought or oversold levels as buy or sell signals.
- RSI performs better in range-bound markets than in trending markets.

## Relative Strength Index (RSI) Working Principle

As a momentum indicator, the Relative Strength Index compares the strength of a security during price increases with its strength during price decreases. Connecting this comparison with price trends can help traders predict security performance. When used in combination with other technical indicators, RSI can help traders make more informed trading decisions.

RSI calculation involves two steps, starting with the following formula:

$$ RSI_{\text{第一步}} = 100- \left[ \frac{100}{ 1 + \frac{\text{平均收益}}{\text{平均损失} }} \right] $$

The average gains or losses used in this calculation are the average percentage gains or losses over the lookback period. The formula uses positive values for average losses. Price loss periods are counted as zero in average gain calculations, and price gain periods are counted as zero in average loss calculations. The standard number of periods for calculating initial RSI values is 14. For example, assume that over the past 14 days, the market rose for 7 days with an initial average gain of 1%; the remaining 7 days all declined with an initial average loss of -0.8%.

The first RSI calculation is as follows:

$$ 55.55 = 100 - \left [ \frac {100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \frac{ 1\% }{ 14 } \right) }{ \left( \frac{ 0.8\% }{ 14 } \right)} } \right ] $$

After obtaining 14 periods of data, a second calculation can be performed. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that RSI values only approach 100 or zero in strong trend markets.

$$ RSI_{\text{第二步}} = 100 - \left [ \frac{ 100 }{ 1 + \frac{ \left ( \text{前期平均收益} \times 13 \right ) \ + \ \text{当前收益} }{ \left ( \left ( \text{前期平均损失} \times 13 \right ) \ + \ \text{当前损失} \right ) } } \right ] $$

Once RSI is calculated, the RSI indicator can be plotted below the asset's price chart. As the number and magnitude of up days increase, RSI will rise; as the number and magnitude of down days increase, RSI will fall.

As shown in the chart above, the RSI indicator may remain in overbought territory for extended periods during stock uptrends. During stock downtrends, the indicator may also stay in oversold territory for long periods. This might confuse new analysts, but learning to use the indicator within the context of the current trend will help clarify these issues.

## Why is RSI Important?

- Traders can use RSI to predict securities price behavior.
- It helps traders validate trends and trend reversals.
- It can indicate overbought and oversold securities.
- It provides buy and sell signals for short-term traders.
- It is a technical indicator that can be combined with other indicators to support trading strategies.

## Combining RSI with Trends

To properly interpret RSI readings, one must understand the primary trend of the security. For example, renowned market technical analyst Constance Brown, CMT suggests that during uptrends, RSI oversold readings typically remain well above 30; while during downtrends, overbought readings tend to stay well below 70.

In the following chart, you can see that during downtrends, RSI peaks approach 50 rather than 70. This can be viewed by traders as a more reliable indication of bearish conditions.

Many investors draw a horizontal trendline between 30 and 70 during strong trends to better identify the overall trend and extreme conditions.

On the other hand, when a stock or asset price is in a long-term horizontal channel or trading range (rather than a strong upward or downward trend), adjusting the overbought or oversold RSI levels is usually unnecessary.

The Relative Strength Index is less reliable in trending markets than in trading ranges. In fact, most traders know that RSI signals during strong upward or downward trends often can be false signals.

A related concept focuses on trend-aligned trading signals and techniques. In other words, primarily using bullish signals in bullish trends and bearish signals in bearish trends may help traders avoid false signals generated by RSI in trending markets.

## Overbought or Oversold

Typically, when the RSI indicator crosses above 30 on the RSI chart, it's considered a bullish signal; when it crosses above 70, it's considered a bearish signal. In other words, an RSI value of 70 or above can be understood to indicate that the security is overbought or overvalued, potentially preparing for a trend reversal or price correction. Conversely, an RSI reading below 30 indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.

Overbought typically refers to a security trading at a price above its true (or intrinsic) value. This means that according to technical or fundamental analysis theory, its price has exceeded a reasonable range. Traders who observe signs of a security being overbought might expect a price adjustment or trend reversal, and therefore may sell that security.

The same principle applies to securities that technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index highlight as oversold. It can be viewed as trading at a level below its justified price. Traders who monitor such indicators might expect a price adjustment or trend reversal, and consequently buy the security.

## RSI and Interpretation of Its Ranges

During trends, RSI readings tend to fall within certain bands or ranges. In an uptrend, RSI tends to stay above 30 and should frequently reach 70. During downtrends, RSI rarely exceeds 70, and in fact, the indicator often remains at or below 30.

These guidelines can help traders determine trend strength and identify potential reversals. For example, if RSI fails to reach 70 in several consecutive price swings during an uptrend, and then breaks below 30, this indicates the trend is weakening and may reverse downward.

The opposite is true for downtrends. If a downtrend fails to reach 30 or below, and then bounces above 70, this suggests the downtrend is weakening and may reverse upward. Trendlines and moving averages are helpful technical tools when using RSI.

**Note:** Be careful not to confuse RSI with Relative Strength. The former refers to momentum changes in a security's price, while the latter compares price performance between two or more securities.

## RSI Divergence Examples

RSI divergence occurs when prices move in the opposite direction of the RSI. In other words, the chart may show changes in momentum before corresponding changes occur in price.

Bullish divergence occurs when RSI shows an oversold reading, followed by a higher low, while price makes a lower low. This may indicate rising bullish momentum, and a breakout from the oversold zone can be used to trigger new long positions.

Bearish divergence occurs when RSI forms an overbought reading, followed by a lower high, while price makes a higher high.

As shown in the chart below, a bullish divergence was identified when RSI formed higher lows while price formed lower lows. This is a valid signal, but divergences may occur infrequently when a stock is in a steady long-term trend. Using flexible overbought or oversold readings will help identify more potential signals.

## Example of Positive and Negative RSI Divergence

Another price-RSI relationship that traders look for is positive and negative RSI divergence. A positive RSI divergence may occur when the RSI reaches a lower low while the security price makes a higher low. Traders view this pattern as a bullish signal and a buy signal.

Conversely, a negative RSI divergence may occur when the RSI reaches a higher high while the security price makes a lower high. This pattern is considered a bearish signal and a sell signal.

## RSI Swing Rejection Example

Another trading technique examines RSI's behavior after it re-emerges from overbought or oversold territories. This signal is called a bullish swing rejection and consists of four parts:

As shown in the following chart, the RSI indicator was oversold, broke above 30 and formed a rejection low, triggering the signal when it bounced back. Using RSI in this way is very similar to drawing trend lines on a price chart.

The bearish swing rejection signal is symmetrical to its bullish counterpart. The bearish swing rejection also has four parts.

The following chart illustrates the bearish swing rejection signal. Like most trading techniques, this signal is most reliable when it aligns with the current long-term trend. A bearish signal in a downtrend is less likely to generate false positives.

## Differences between RSI and MACD

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is another trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. This calculation result is the MACD line.

Then, the 9-day EMA of MACD, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD line. It can act as a trigger for buy and sell signals. Traders may buy the security when MACD crosses above the signal line and sell or short the security when MACD crosses below the signal line.

RSI aims to indicate whether a security is overbought or oversold relative to recent price levels. It is calculated by measuring the average gains and losses over a given time period, typically defaulting to 14 periods, with values ranging between 0 and 100.

MACD measures the relationship between two EMAs, while RSI measures price change momentum relative to recent highs and lows. These two indicators are often used together to provide analysts with a more complete technical picture of the market.

Both indicators measure asset momentum. However, they measure different factors and can therefore sometimes give contradictory signals. For example, RSI might show readings above 70 for an extended period, indicating that a security is overextended on the buy side.

Meanwhile, MACD might indicate that buying momentum is still increasing for that security. Either indicator can signal an impending trend change by showing divergence from price (price continues to rise while the indicator falls, or vice versa).

## RSI Limitations

RSI compares bullish and bearish price momentum and displays the results as an oscillator indicator below the price chart. Like most technical indicators, its signals are most reliable when they align with the long-term trend.

Genuine reversal signals are relatively rare and can be difficult to distinguish from false signals. An example of a false signal is when a bullish crossover is immediately followed by a sharp price decline. A misreading occurs when a bearish crossover is followed by a dramatic price increase.

Since the indicator shows momentum, RSI can remain in overbought or oversold conditions for extended periods when an asset has significant momentum. Therefore, RSI is most useful in oscillating markets (trading ranges) where asset prices alternate between bullish and bearish trends.

## What does RSI stand for?

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the price momentum of a stock or other security. The basic concept of RSI is to measure how rapidly traders are pushing the security's price up or down. RSI plots this result on a scale from 0 to 100.

A reading below 30 typically indicates that a stock is oversold, while a reading above 70 indicates that it is overbought. Traders usually place this RSI chart below a security's price chart to compare its recent momentum with market prices.

## Should I Buy When RSI is Low?

Some traders believe that when a security's RSI reading falls below 30, it represents a buy signal. This idea is based on the premise that the security is oversold and therefore ready for a rebound. However, the reliability of this signal depends to some extent on the overall context. If the security is in a significant downward trend, it may continue to trade at oversold levels for an extended period. In such cases, traders might delay buying until they see confirmation from other technical indicators.

## What Happens When RSI Is High?

Since the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is primarily used to determine whether a security is overbought or oversold, a high RSI reading may indicate that the security is overbought and prices are likely to fall. Therefore, this could be a signal to sell the security.

## What is the difference between RSI and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)?

RSI and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are both momentum measurement tools that help traders understand recent trading activity of a security. However, they achieve this goal through different methods.

In simple terms, MACD works by smoothing out recent price movements of a security and comparing this medium-term trend line with a shorter-term trend line that shows more recent price changes. Traders can thus make buy and sell decisions based on whether the short-term trend line is rising or falling.
